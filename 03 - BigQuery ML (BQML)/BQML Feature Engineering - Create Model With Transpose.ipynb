This provides the benefit of also automatically including the same preprocessing during serving with the [`ML.PREDICT` function](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-predict) and transportability by including the preprocessing within the [exported models](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/exporting-models) and models [directly registered to Vertex AI Model Registry](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/create_vertex).
