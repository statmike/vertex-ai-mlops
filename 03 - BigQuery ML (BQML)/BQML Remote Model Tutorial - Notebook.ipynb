    "[BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805) and other Transformer encoder architectures have been wildly successful on a variety of tasks in NLP (natural language processing). They compute vector-space representations of natural language that are suitable for use in deep learning models. The BERT family of models uses the Transformer encoder architecture to process each token of input text in the full context of all tokens before and after, hence the name: Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. \n",

Most of the scenes in this movie had me sitting there in stunned silence because the movie wasn\\'t all that funny. There are a few laughs in the film, but when you watch a comedy, you expect to laugh a lot more than a few times and that\\'s all this film has going for it.

His first movie 'House of Games' was the one I liked best, and it set a series of films with characters whose perspective of life changes as they get into complicated situations, and so does the perspective of the viewer.<br /><br />So is 'Homicide' which from the title tries to set the mind of the viewer to the usual crime drama. The principal characters are two cops, one Jewish and one Irish who deal with a racially charged area. The murder of an old Jewish shop owner who proves to be an ancient veteran of the Israeli Independence war triggers the Jewish identity in the mind and heart of the Jewish detective.<br /><br />This is were the flaws of the film are the more obvious. The process of awakening is theatrical and hard to believe, the group of Jewish militants is operatic, and the way the detective eventually walks to the final violent confrontation is pathetic. The end of the film itself is Mamet-like smart, but disappoints from a human emotional perspective.<br /><br />Joe Mantegna and William Macy give strong performances, but the flaws of the story are too evident to be easily compensated.\"\n",

    "  - [Small BERTs](https://tfhub.dev/google/collections/bert/1) have the same general architecture but fewer and/or smaller Transformer blocks, which lets you explore tradeoffs between speed, size and quality.\n",
    "  - [ALBERT](https://tfhub.dev/google/collections/albert/1): four different sizes of \"A Lite BERT\" that reduces model size (but not computation time) by sharing parameters between layers.\n",
    "  - [BERT Experts](https://tfhub.dev/google/collections/experts/bert/1): eight models that all have the BERT-base architecture but offer a choice between different pre-training domains, to align more closely with the target task.\n",
    "  - [Electra](https://tfhub.dev/google/collections/electra/1) has the same architecture as BERT (in three different sizes), but gets pre-trained as a discriminator in a set-up that resembles a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN).\n",
    "  - BERT with Talking-Heads Attention and Gated GELU [[base](https://tfhub.dev/tensorflow/talkheads_ggelu_bert_en_base/1), [large](https://tfhub.dev/tensorflow/talkheads_ggelu_bert_en_large/1)] has two improvements to the core of the Transformer architecture.\n",
