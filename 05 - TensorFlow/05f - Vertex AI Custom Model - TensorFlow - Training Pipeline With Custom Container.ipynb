Running these notebooks will create a Vertex AI TensorBoard instance which previously (before August 2023) had a subscription cost but is now priced based on storage of which this notebook will create minimal size (<2MB). - [Vertex AI Pricing](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/pricing#tensorboard).\n",

    "Where a model gets trained is where it consumes computing resources.  With Vertex AI, you have choices for configuring the computing resources available at training.  This notebook is an example of an execution environment.  When it was set up there were choices for machine type and accelerators (GPUs).  \n",
