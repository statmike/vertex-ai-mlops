# /05 - TensorFlow/TensorFlow/readme.md

A series of introductory workflows focused as getting started guides for users with familiarity with other frameworks and wanting to get started using TensorFlow.

Start with an overview of methods for reading tabular data into TensorFlow training:
- [TensorFlow Basics - Data To Training](./TensorFlow%20Basics%20-%20Data%20To%20Training.ipynb)


For a similar set of progressive workflow focused on autoencoders see the series [Applied Autoencoders](../../Applied%20Autoencoders/readme.md).
