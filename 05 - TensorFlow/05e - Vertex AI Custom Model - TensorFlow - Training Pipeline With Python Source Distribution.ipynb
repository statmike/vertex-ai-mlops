Running these notebooks will create a Vertex AI TensorBoard instance which previously (before August 2023) had a subscription cost but is now priced based on storage of which this notebook will create minimal size (<2MB). - [Vertex AI Pricing](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/pricing#tensorboard).\n",
    "\n",
    "Where a model gets trained is where it consumes computing resources.  With Vertex AI, you have choices for configuring the computing resources available at training.  This notebook is an example of an execution environment.  When it was set up there were choices for machine type and accelerators (GPUs).  \n",

The model was then imported to Vertex AI and deployed to an endpoint for online predictions. \n",

    "In this `05a-05i` series of demonstrations, the same model is trained using managed computing resources in Vertex AI Training as managed jobs.  These jobs will be demonstrated as:\n",
