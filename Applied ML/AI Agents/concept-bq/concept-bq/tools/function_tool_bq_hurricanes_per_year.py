    Queries the BigQuery NOAA public dataset to count hurricanes per year.

    This function executes a SQL query that counts the number of distinct hurricanes
    in the North Atlantic basin for each year. The results are ordered by the
    hurricane count in descending order. The final output is formatted as a
    markdown table.

        tool_context: The execution context for the tool, provided by the ADK framework.

    Returns:
        A markdown-formatted string containing a table of years and their
        corresponding hurricane counts, or an error message if the query fails.
