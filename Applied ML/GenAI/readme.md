This section covers workflows for working with [Generative AI on Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/overview), which are large models trained to continue inputs with likely outputs. While simply prompting an LLM for helpful responses is a great starting point, the tools surrounding these models unlock even more use cases and enhance usefulness.

Prompts can be augmented with retrieved information (RAG) related to a query. Evaluating prompts with metrics allows for prompt optimization to maximize metric scores. Incorporating examples can enable supervised tuning of models for refined, targeted response types. Controlling response generation, such as enforcing JSON structures, allows for validation and enables actions to be takenâ€”even directly through function calling and execution.

These techniques are proving transformative for many business use cases like:
- search, and search with answers grounded in personal data with citations
- classification, including defined enums and multi-label classification
- summarization
- extraction, including extraction to defined schemas
