Once [embeddings](../Embeddings/readme.md) are generated for the pieces of content ([chunks](../Chunking/readme.md)), it is helpful to create a **retrieval** system that can be queried for similar matching chunks. This could be a brute-force solution or an index-based system that surfaces neighbors for query embeddings. Some solutions can store embedding vectors along with the text/image as well as other metadata. Other systems are designed to return the matching entity IDs, and a second step is needed to retrieve the text/image related to those entities. This section will review implementing a retrieval system with various Google Cloud offerings that span the set of features introduced here and can be used individually or together to fit your application workflow(s).

This retrieval process is what is usually referred to as retrieval augmented generation, or RAG, but is actually just the retrieval portion. Read more about the full process in the parent series of this content: [Applied GenAI](../readme.md), which includes a common next step of [ranking/re-ranking](../Ranking/readme.md) of the matched content.  Each of these workflows includes a full simple RAG example at the end!

**Workflow Details**

Each of these workflows sets up the solution and inserts the same 9040 embeddings with metadata:
- Document processing done in this workflow: [Large Document Processing - Document AI Layout Parser](../Chunking/Large%20Document%20Processing%20-%20Document%20AI%20Layout%20Parser.ipynb)
- Embedding calls done in batch in this workflow: [Vertex AI Text Embeddings API](../Embeddings/Vertex%20AI%20Text%20Embeddings%20API.ipynb)

The workflows import the resulting data and create the same starting point which is a Python list of dictionaries like:

```python
content_chunks = List[Dict(
    gse: str,
    chunk_id: str,
    content: str,
    embedding: List[float],  # 768-dimensional vector of float32 values
)]
```

Key-Value Pairs:
- `gse` holds values 'fannie' or 'freddie'
    - used in pre-filtering example to limit search to a one document source
    - used as crowding attribute in solutions that offer this functionality
- `chunk_id` is a unique id for a chunk of text like `fannie_part_0_c17`
    - indicates both the document, the part of the document, and the individual chunk id from the part
- `content` is the actual text chunk including a heading tree from the document structure
- `embedding` is the result of using the Vertex AI Text Embedding API to generate a text embedding

For each solution the minimal environment is choosen for the testing/development stage and is suitable for test or POC.  Here is a summary of the workflows choices for environments creation along with an approximate daily running cost when idle.  Each workflow includes code at the bottom for stopping all services and removing on going costs.

## Important Notes About Setting Up An Index Solution

When working with embeddings—vectors of numbers represented as lists of floating points—there are key considerations for choosing and configuring a vector database solution.  Here are some crucial aspects to keep in mind:

- **Storage**
    - **Filterable attributes:**  Include values that can be used to filter search results (e.g., date, category, source).
    - **Crowding attributes:**  Use these to limit the number of similar matches returned (e.g., author, publication).
    - **Inline data:** Store the text chunk associated with each embedding directly to avoid an extra retrieval step.
    - **Metadata:**  Include relevant metadata like file name, location in the file, page number, etc.
    - **Normalization:** Consider automatic calculation and storage of normalized embeddings for efficient comparisons.

- **Indexing**
    - **Brute-force search:**  Offer a configuration for exhaustive search across all embeddings, useful for benchmarking and establishing ground truth retrieval.
    - **Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search:** Provide methods for efficient approximate search, such as:
        - **Inverted File (IVF) index:**  Clustering embeddings using algorithms like k-means.
        - **Tree-based methods:**  Hierarchical approaches like TreeAH.
        - **Quantization techniques:**  Compressing embeddings using methods like ScaNN ([link to ScaNN research blog](https://research.google/blog/announcing-scann-efficient-vector-similarity-search/)).
    - **Index parameters:** Allow configuration of cluster size (IVF) or leaf node size (TreeAH) to tune performance.
    - **Distance metrics:**  Support various distance metrics for similarity calculations (e.g., dot product, Euclidean, Manhattan, cosine).

- **Retrieval**
    - **Brute-force override:**  Enable an option to override ANN search and perform a brute-force search for ground truth retrieval.
    - **Control over retrieved neighbors:** Allow users to specify the number of neighbors to retrieve.
    - **Distance metric override:** Allow users to override the default distance metric at query time.
    - **Filtering and crowding:**  Enable the use of filterable and crowding attributes to refine the list of retrieved neighbors.
    - **Rich result sets:**  Return more than just match IDs; include the content, metadata, and similarity scores.
