    ">It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way--in short, the period was so far like the present period that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you are the author and have started writing this paragraph.  How likely is it to end up with these words?\n",
    "\n",
    "You start with 'It'.  That narrows down what comes next.  Given all of the text samples an LLM is trained on we can detect the most likely next word and it is 'was'.  \n",
    "Now start with 'It was'.  What comes next?\n",
    "\n",
    "How long before we start with enough text that the LLM can actually decide the mostly likely continuation is the exact same passage?  After as few as 5 words an LLM may recite the remainder of the paragrph as the sequence is that unique!\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because the LLM was trained, learned from, a large amount of text which certainly contained this very popular book that is also in the [public domain](https://www.loc.gov/item/05000749/)."
