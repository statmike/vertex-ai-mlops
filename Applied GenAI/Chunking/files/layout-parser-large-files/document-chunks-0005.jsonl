The Seller should be prepared to address these feedback messages as part of their appraisal report review and property underwriting process. For certain Mortgages, the Seller may receive a message indicating the appraisal is eligible for collateral representation and warranty relief. See Section 5602.2 for more details and eligibility requirements related to this representation and warranty relief. Note: The presence of one or more feedback message(s) with a \u201cwarning\u201d severity indicator does not prevent the \u201csuccessful\u201d submission of an appraisal report to the UCDP and does not deem the property ineligible or the appraisal report unacceptable.

The Seller must consider this high-risk characteristic in evaluating the overall risk of the Mortgage and avoid combining a Manufactured Home with Page 5703-18 weaknesses in the components of capacity and credit reputation. See Section 5102.2 for more information on evaluating layering of risk and how to document that the overall risk of the Mortgage is acceptable. For example, a Mortgage secured by a Manufactured Home with maximum financing is acceptable if the Borrower has a strong credit reputation and strong capacity to offset the high risk within the collateral component. However, if the Borrower has weaknesses in credit reputation, such as a credit history of short duration or derogatory credit information, the layering of risk across credit reputation and collateral is excessive and would make the Mortgage unacceptable."}
