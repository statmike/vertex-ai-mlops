The delivery instructions are cumulative, so that, for example, the Seller must provide data regarding the specific delivery program, the particular Mortgage product, the property, loan and Borrower, as well as any special characteristics that the loan may have. The data delivery instructions set forth in this chapter include requirements for delivery of Investor Feature Identifiers (IFIs) in connection with the sale of Mortgages to Freddie M\u0430\u0441, where applicable. IFIs identify a loan feature not defined by other attributes. A listing of IFIs is available in Exhibit 34, Investor Feature Identifiers."}

Under this method, an individual Mortgage payment is applied to interest and principal by first calculating the interest portion and then applying the balance of the payment as a principal reduction. Unless otherwise specifically required by law, the interest portion of the payment must be determined by computing one full month's interest on the outstanding principal balance (Exhibit 62, Interest Calculation: Amortization Method) regardless of the day on which the payment is actually received. To determine the interest due for the month, multiply the outstanding principal balance by the interest rate of the Mortgage and divide by 12. Factors used for interest calculations must be carried to at least six decimal places, then rounded to the nearest decimal place based on the third digit. After applying the interest portion of the payment, the remainder is applied to principal."}

If applicable law specifically requires a different method, the Servicer must so notify Freddie Mac (see Directory 7) in writing before remitting payments to Freddie Mac. When computations involve multiple installments, such as several delinquent installments, the interest from each may be computed using the same principal balance (Exhibit 63, Interest Calculation: Amortization Method). The amount to be applied to interest from each installment also may be calculated in succession, using the principal balance remaining after the previous calculation and principal application (Exhibit 64, Interest Calculation: Amortization Method). Similarly, a method that strictly applies payments according to a predetermined amortization schedule is also acceptable. For Initial Interests\u2122 Mortgages, the monthly payment will be interest-only followed by fully amortizing principal and interest payments beginning on the First Amortizing Payment Date. For Initial Interest Mortgages, Servicers must have the ability to produce monthly payment statements for Borrowers."}
