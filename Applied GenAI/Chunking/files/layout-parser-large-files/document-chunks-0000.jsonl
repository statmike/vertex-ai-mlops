A lender also breaches the Lender Contract in the event of a change in the lender's financial or business condition, or in its operations, which in Fannie Mae's sole judgment, is material and adverse.

Any remedies that are applied will, in Fannie Mae's sole judgment, be commensurate with the associated level of risk. Generally, Fannie Mae pursues these remedies when it believes that the lender should have an opportunity to correct the breach of the Lender Contract. Instead of terminating all or a part of the Lender Contract (or the lender's selling arrangement or servicing arrangement) when it has cause to do so, Fannie Mae may elect to pursue a variety of other remedies and/or may impose additional requirements as a condition for not terminating all or a part of the Lender Contract (or the lender's selling arrangement or servicing arrangement). The following list provides some possible requirements that Fannie Mae may impose as a condition for not undertaking remedies to which it is entitled by virtue of a lender's breach: \u2022 requiring the lender to indemnify Fannie Mae for actual and prospective Fannie Mae losses; \u2022 requiring the lender to repurchase a mortgage loan or an acquired property or remit a make whole payment; \u2022 imposing a compensatory fee;"}

Prior to imposing any sanction, Fannie Mae will generally give the lender notice of the contemplated action so the lender can submit a written response or request a meeting with its Fannie Mae customer account team. The lender's written response must include a description and explanation of any mitigating circumstances or specific proposals to satisfy Fannie Mae's objections to the lender's performance of its obligations under the Lender Contract. Fannie Mae reserves the right to omit these steps and take immediate action to terminate or suspend the Lender Contract at any time in accordance with the provisions thereof."}

Fannie Mae may apply the suspension of a selling arrangement to all products or to specific products, depending on the type and seriousness of the lender's failure to perform. Even when Fannie Mae suspends a lender's selling arrangement, it will honor any outstanding whole loan commitments and MBS pool purchase contracts. However, if Fannie Mae decides to terminate the lender's selling arrangement (or the entire Lender Contract) for cause either at or before the end of the suspension period, it may declare any outstanding pricing or purchase commitments or pool purchase contracts to be void."}

During the QC reviews, Fannie Mae may identify a \"defect\"-a loan-level deficiency that breaches a term contained in the Lender Contract in effect at the time of loan delivery. These reviews may result in loan repurchase demands, make whole payment demands, or other alternative remedies. Fannie Mae requires some repurchases because the terms under which the mortgages were purchased or securitized call for a repurchase under certain conditions or circumstances. Repurchases that fall into this category generally include, but are not limited to, Charter violations, an adjustable-rate mortgage in an MBS pool that has converted to a fixed-rate mortgage per the borrower's exercise of its option in the mortgage documents, or an MBS mortgage that has 24 payments past due."}

These flexibilities are provided to account for unusual circumstances beyond the lender's control that prevent the lender from honoring its contractual obligations. However, Fannie Mae may impose compensatory fees when it has reason to believe that the lender had control over the situation or failed to comply with Fannie Mae requirements in an effort to take advantage of changing market conditions.

There are two primary motivations for committing mortgage fraud. \u2022 Fraud for house is motivated by a desire to get a marginal borrower into a house and may involve misrepresentation of information on loan applications. \u2022 Fraud for profit is motivated by a desire of mortgage participants to improperly acquire mortgage loan proceeds for personal gain. Often fraud for profit schemes involve a pattern: two or more mortgage loans, multiple parties in various roles within the mortgage industry, and no true intent to repay the mortgage. Participants in fraud schemes can include borrowers, originators, appraisers, brokers, real estate agents, closing agents, builders, lenders, and title companies. There are a variety of types of mortgage fraud including: \u2022 undisclosed liabilities, \u2022 misrepresentation of income or employment, \u2022 misrepresentation of credit, \u2022 identity theft and/or Social Security number discrepancy, \u2022 misrepresentation of assets, Published September 4, 2024 125 \u2714 Fannie Mae \u2022 misrepresentation of occupancy, \u2022 misrepresentation of property value, \u2022 property flips based on inflated appraisals or other false characteristics,"}

ATR Covered Loans. An ATR Covered Loan is a loan subject to the TILA's ability to repay requirements under Regulation Z and is otherwise not an ATR Exempt Loan (defined below). An ATR Covered Loan must meet the following requirements in addition to the other underwriting and eligibility requirements in the Selling Guide: \u2022 have a loan term not exceeding 30 years (see Acceptable Loan Terms below); \u2022 be a fully amortizing loan, as defined in Regulation Z: \u2022 the loan must have regular periodic payments that are substantially equal that do not result in an increase in the principal balance or allow the borrower to defer repayment of principal;"}

An ATR Exempt Loan is, with certain exceptions, a loan that either is not subject to TILA or is exempt from the ability to repay requirements in Regulation Z (12 CFR \u00a7 1026.43(a) or (d)).

The non-credit risk factors evaluated by DU include: the borrower's equity and LTV ratio, liquid reserves, loan purpose, loan term, loan amortization type, occupancy type, debt-to-income ratio, housing expense ratio, property type, and variable income. DU performs a comprehensive evaluation of these factors, weighing each factor based on the amount of risk it represents and its importance to the recommendation. DU analyzes the results of this evaluation along with the evaluation of the borrower's credit profile to arrive at the underwriting recommendation for the loan casefile. More information on these risk factors is provided below. Also see below for information about the risk factors DU considers when evaluating loans where no borrower has a credit score."}

An older, established history-even though the accounts may have zero balances\u2014will have a more positive impact on the borrower's credit profile than newly established accounts. A borrower who has a relatively new credit history (a few recently opened accounts) is not automatically considered a high credit risk.

DU considers the severity of the delinquencies (30, 60, 90, or more days late), the length of time since the delinquencies, and the number and type of accounts that were not paid as agreed. A payment history that includes bills that are 30 days or more past-due, or a history of paying bills late as evidenced by a number of accounts with late payments, will have a negative impact on the borrower's credit profile. The amount of time that has elapsed since an account was delinquent is an important factor included in the evaluation of the payment history. For example, a 30-day late payment that is less than three months old indicates a higher risk than a 30-day late payment that occurred several years ago.\n\n## Installment Loans\n\nDU evaluates how well a borrower manages debt for all types of installment loans such as mortgage, auto, unsecured, and student loans. Research has shown that borrowers with no active installment accounts represent a higher risk than borrowers who have active installment accounts."}

When DU logic can identify rent payments in the asset verification report, it will use the rent payment history to positively supplement the credit risk assessment. The following requirements apply when using rent payment history in DU: \u2022 At least one borrower must \u2022 be a first-time homebuyer purchasing a principal residence, \u2022 have a credit score (nontraditional credit is not permitted), and \u2022 have been renting for at least 12 months with a monthly rent payment of at least $300. \u2022 For DU to be able to identify rent payments, the lender must \u2022 enter the monthly rent paid by the borrower in the online loan application, \u2022 obtain an asset verification report with 12 months of bank statement data through an authorized DU validation service asset verification report vendor, and \u2022 confirm the borrower is an account holder and that the account provided in the asset verification report is the one from which the borrower pays rent."}

Trended credit data is used to evaluate the borrower's ability to manage revolving accounts.

The more recent such events occurred, the more adverse the impact is on the credit profile. Although most public record information is retained in the credit history for seven years (ten years for bankruptcies), as time passes, it does become less significant to DU's credit evaluation. | Note: Collection accounts reported as medical collections are not used in the DU risk assessment.\n\n# Inquiries\n\nDU evaluates inquiries made within the most recent 12 months of the credit report date. Research has shown that a high number of inquiries can indicate a higher degree of risk. However, multiple inquiries made by different mortgage lenders or different auto loan creditors within the same time frame is not viewed by DU as multiple inquiries (these types of inquiries generally reflect borrowers shopping for favorable rates or terms).

For example, if a loan casefile is submitted with a loan amount of $100,000 and the appraised value is $120,000 (which equals 83.3% LTV), the actual loan amount can go up to $100,500 (which equals 83.75% LTV) without requiring resubmission. On the other hand, if the original loan amount was $108,000 (90% LTV), an increase without resubmission is not permitted because it would result in an LTV of 91%. The higher LTV requires different mortgage insurance coverage, and may result in the loan not being eligible for delivery."}

The stable and reliable flow of income is a key consideration in mortgage loan underwriting. Individuals who change jobs frequently, but who are nevertheless able to earn consistent and predictable income, are also considered to have a reliable flow of income for qualifying purposes. To demonstrate the likelihood that a consistent level of income will continue to be received for borrowers with less predictable sources of income, the lender must obtain information about prior earnings. Examples of less predictable income sources include commissions, bonuses, substantial amounts of overtime pay, or employment that is subject to time limits, such as contract employees or tradesmen."}

Examples of income of this type include income from hourly workers with fluctuating hours, or income that includes Published September 4, 2024 300 commissions, bonuses, or overtime. History of Receipt: Two or more years of receipt of a particular type of variable income is recommended; however, variable income that has been received for 12 to 24 months may be considered as acceptable income, as long as the borrower's loan application demonstrates that there are positive factors that reasonably offset the shorter income history. For loans with variable income validated by the DU validation service, the required history of receipt may differ from the requirements described above. DU will determine the history required to validate an income type. Frequency of Payment: The lender must determine the frequency of the payment (weekly, biweekly, monthly, quarterly, or annually) to arrive at an accurate calculation of the monthly income to be used in the trending analysis (see below). Examples:"}

Note that dividing the bonus received on March 31^{st} by three months produces a much higher, inaccurate monthly average. \u2022 If a borrower is paid overtime on a biweekly basis, the most recent paystub must be analyzed to determine that both the current overtime earnings for the period and the year-to-date overtime earnings are consistent and, if not, why. There are legitimate reasons why these amounts may be inconsistent yet still eligible for use as qualifying income. For example, borrowers may have overtime income that is cyclical (such as transportation employees who operate snow plows in winter, package delivery service workers who work longer hours through the holidays). The lender must investigate the difference between current period overtime and year-to-date earnings and document the analysis before using the income amount in the trending analysis."}

MCCs enable an eligible first-time homebuyer to obtain a mortgage secured by their principal residence and to claim a federal tax credit for a specified percentage (usually 20% to 25%) of the mortgage interest payments. When calculating the borrower's DTI ratio, treat the maximum possible MCC income as an addition to the borrower's income, rather than as a reduction to the amount of the borrower's mortgage payment. Use the following calculation when determining the available income: [(Mortgage Amount) x (Note Rate) x (MCC %)] \u00f7 12 = Amount added to borrower's monthly income. For example, if a borrower obtains a $100,000 mortgage that has a note rate of 7.5% and they are eligible for a 20% credit under the MCC program, the amount that should be added to their monthly income would be $125 (\\$100,000\\times7.5\\%\\times20\\%=\\$1500\\div12=\\$125).

The fundamental exercise, when conducting a self-employment income cash flow analysis, is to determine the amount of income that can be relied on by the borrower in qualifying for their personal mortgage obligation. When underwriting these borrowers, it is important to review business income distributions that have been made or could be made to these borrowers while maintaining the viability of the underlying business. This analysis includes assessing the stability of business income and the ability of the business to continue to generate sufficient income to enable these borrowers to meet their financial obligations."}

The distribution of profits earned by the business is determined by the corporation's board of directors or other entities that have a significant financial interest in the business. However, the profits usually are filtered down to the owners in the form of dividends. Since a stockholder is not personally liable for the debts of the corporation, losses are limited to their individual investment in the corporation's stock. Corporations must report income and losses on IRS Form 1120 and pay taxes on the net income. The corporation distributes profits to its shareholders in the form of dividends, which it reports on IRS Form 1099- DIV. The shareholders must then report the dividends as income on their individual IRS Form 1040.
