These affordable housing programs are often based on State or local inclusionary housing policies, which typically require a specified number or percentage of properties in a designated area to be dedicated as housing individuals and households with very low-, low- or moderate-incomes. These resale restrictions are typically administered by a subsidy provider or program administrator. The income-based resale restrictions restrict the initial sales price and subsequent resale price of properties subject to such restrictions. The resale restricted price provides a form of subsidy to the homebuyer in an amount equal to the difference between the sales price and the market value of the property without resale restrictions. The restrictions must be stated in a separate covenant, restriction, easement, or condition in a deed or other instrument executed by or on behalf of the owner of the land or property and must be recorded against that land or property. These restrictions may be in effect for a certain number of years or continue in perpetuity."}

Multiple characteristics that increase risk without sufficient offsetting factors are likely to result in excessive risk layering. An offsetting factor does not need to be established for each risk factor if the overall risk is balanced. The Seller's conclusion that a Mortgage has acceptable layering of risk must be documented in the file and at a minimum include: The identified risk factors The identified offsetting factors Documentation of the offsetting factors A written conclusion that the Mortgage does not exhibit excessive layering of risks The Seller must determine that each component (credit reputation, capacity and collateral) is acceptable and that the overall layering of risk is acceptable. A conclusion that the Mortgage is acceptable cannot be reached by looking only at a single underwriting component or by placing the most weight on a single component, but may result from balancing the weakness of one component against the strength of the other"}

For example, a Borrower with weak capacity may be found to be acceptable because of strong collateral and credit reputation, but a Borrower with weak capacity and weak credit reputation is not acceptable because only collateral is strong. Even when each of the three components is acceptable, layered risk may make a Mortgage unacceptable. Characteristics specific to the Mortgage request, such as the type of Mortgage product, the purpose of the Mortgage and the property type securing the Mortgage, add layers of risk that must be considered. For instance: An ARM adds an additional layer of capacity risk to a Mortgage request that would not be present in a fixed-rate Mortgage A cash-out refinance Mortgage adds an additional layer of capacity risk to a Mortgage request that would not be present in a \u201cno cash-out\u201d refinance Mortgage A Mortgage secured by a 2- to 4-unit property or a Condominium Unit adds a layer of collateral risk that would not be present in a Mortgage secured by a 1-unit detached dwelling"}

A FICO Score is an effective tool in evaluating a Borrower's credit reputation; however, it does not necessarily indicate that the Borrower's credit reputation is acceptable.

However, if several of the Borrower's credit accounts showed late payments, or the Borrower's Mortgage or installment loan were also late, the single late on the charge account ten months ago may be considered significant, so the Seller should obtain a letter of explanation from the Borrower and include it in the Mortgage file. A written explanation is required for significant derogatory information.

When the credit report indicates that a creditor has made an inquiry within the previous 90-day period, the Seller must determine whether additional credit was granted.

In addition, several recent inquiries, combined with a credit history of short duration may make even mild derogatory credit information significant. To address how risk evidenced by several recent inquiries, layered with other credit reputation risks, affects the Borrower's overall credit reputation, the Seller must look at: The Borrower's payment history The age of the Borrower's other credit The type of credit being sought The total amount of credit outstanding, and The overall credit utilization reflected on the report (b) Age of accounts For Manually Underwritten Mortgages, the Seller must review the age of the Borrower's credit obligations to determine whether there has been a recent, significant increase in the number of open accounts.

The Seller should also review the age of accounts to determine if there has been a significant change in the Borrower's credit profile.

Multiple revolving accounts with balances more than 50% of their limits must be considered as additional risk when evaluating credit reputation. The more accounts with high balances-to-limits and the higher the percentage used, the higher the risk. High balances-to-limits may also indicate the Borrower is making minimum payments on revolving accounts rather than reducing the debt and may be at or near payment capacity.

The higher the Borrower's overall utilization of revolving credit, the higher the amount of risk. A pattern of revolving accounts at or near their limits, and utilization of a high proportion of the overall revolving credit available to the Borrower, especially when combined with newly opened accounts, indicates that the Borrower is becoming overextended and there is significant risk in the Borrower's credit reputation. The Seller may not use the lack of adverse or derogatory credit information as an offset for high balances-to-limits or high overall utilization of revolving credit.

Additional documentation may be necessary to evaluate, justify and explain the qualification of the Borrower. This includes scenarios in which the Seller has knowledge that the documentation originally provided by the Borrower may not be reflective of the Borrower's current level of income, even though it meets the age of documentation requirements. For example, a more recent paystub may be necessary if the Borrower's industry was impacted by economic conditions or wide-spread business closures after the original paystub was provided, potentially affecting hours worked and income received. All documentation must be maintained in the Mortgage file. The documentation requirements are the same for both Streamlined Accept and Standard Documentation.

All income must be expected to continue or have documented continuance for at least three years as described in this chapter. The Seller must analyze all income documentation while taking into consideration the characteristics of the employed income (e.g., employment source, income type and stability of the employment history, including any gaps in employment). A Borrower who has had different types of employment in the past may be considered to have stable income if the income amount has remained at a consistent level. When evaluating a Borrower who has frequently changed jobs, the Seller must focus on whether the changes have affected the Borrower's ability to pay their obligations."}

For Borrowers who are active-duty members of the U.S. Armed Forces, a history of military employment is not required for the employment to be considered stable. Tenure with the same employer or in a similar industry lends support to the analysis of employment stability. When a Borrower has less than a two-year history of primary employment, the Seller must provide its justification for determining that the employment is stable, taking into consideration factors such as income and/or employment characteristics and the overall layering of risk factors, including the Borrower's demonstrated ability to repay obligations.
