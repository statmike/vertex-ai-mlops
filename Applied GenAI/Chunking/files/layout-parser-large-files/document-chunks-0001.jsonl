This level of documentation may not be adequate for every borrower and every situation. The lender must determine whether additional documentation is warranted. If the lender is unable to determine the stability of the borrower's income on the basis of the available documentation, the income must be removed and the loan resubmitted to DU. The standards for employment documentation are the same for DU loan casefiles as they are for manually underwritten loans. For example, paystubs, W-2s, and tax returns must meet the same requirements without regard to the underwriting method. The following information describes DU considerations for specific types of income. For additional information, see B1-1-03, Allowable Age of Credit Documents and Federal Income Tax Returns, and Section B3-3.1, Employment and Other Sources of Income. Note: Only actual employer information should be entered in the employment section of the loan Published September 4, 2024 383 \u2714 Fannie Mae application.

The borrower's history of credit use should be a factor in determining whether the appropriate approach is to include or exclude debt for qualification. Generally \u2022 Installment loans that are being paid off or paid down to 10 or fewer remaining monthly payments do not need to be included in the borrower's long-term debt. \u2022 If a revolving account balance is to be paid off at or prior to closing, a monthly payment on the current outstanding balance does not need to be included in the borrower's long-term debt, i.e., not included in the debt-to-income (DTI) ratio. Such accounts do not need to be closed as a condition of excluding the payment from the DTI ratio. See B3-6-02, Debt-to-Income Ratios for additional guidance on calculating total monthly obligations for qualifying purposes."}

The verified funds must be in addition to any funds required for closing costs and reserves. Note: DU will include the balance of the 30-day charge accounts on the loan application in the Reserves Required to be Verified amount shown on the DU Underwriting Findings report.

Implicit in this definition is the consummation of a sale as of a specified date and the passing of title from seller to buyer under conditions whereby: \u2022 buyer and seller are typically motivated; \u2022 both parties are well informed or well advised, and each acting in what they consider to be in their own best interest; \u2022 a reasonable time is allowed for exposure in the open market; \u2022 payment is made in terms of cash in U.S. dollars or in terms of financial arrangements comparable 509 thereto; and \u2022 the price represents the normal consideration for the property sold unaffected by special or creative financing or sales concessions granted by anyone associated with the sale."}

No adjustments are necessary for those costs that are normally paid by sellers as a result of tradition or law in a market area; these costs are readily identifiable because the seller pays these costs in virtually all sales transactions. Special or creative financing adjustments can be made to the comparable property by comparisons to financing terms offered by a third-party institutional lender that is not already involved in the property or transaction. Any adjustment should not be calculated on a mechanical dollar for dollar cost of the financing or concession, but the dollar amount of any adjustment should approximate the market's reaction to the financing or concessions based on the appraiser's judgment.

To confirm that any positive or negative effects of the mixed land uses are reflected in the sales comparison analysis, the appraiser should select comparable sales from within the same neighborhood whenever possible. If this is not possible, the appraiser may need to make neighborhood or location adjustments to the Sales Comparison Approach adjustment grid for any sales that are not subject to the same neighborhood characteristic.

The appraiser should select the rating that best reflects the property as a whole and in its entirety. \u2022 describe the subject property as of the effective date of the appraisal on an absolute basis, meaning the property must be rated on its own merits. The rating should not be selected on a relative basis, meaning it is not selected on how the property relates or compares to other properties in the neighborhood. Additionally, the condition and quality ratings for comparable properties must be made on an absolute basis (again, each comparative property on its own merits), not on a relative basis, and reflect the property as of the date of sale of that comparable property.

For example, if a C4 rating is selected for the sale of the subject property, then that property remains a C4 when using that specific sale as a comparable in future reports. The same expectation holds true for ratings and descriptions of comparable sales. When a comparable is used in a subsequent appraisal, the ratings and descriptions of that property should not change from one appraisal to the next when it reflects the same sale transaction. Note: Properties can have the same rating or description and still require an adjustment. It should be noted that this does not only apply to condition and quality ratings and can apply to other ratings or descriptions as well. For example, all water views may not be equal.

Fannie Mae expects the appraiser to account for all factors that affect value when completing the analysis. Comparable sales should have similar physical and legal characteristics when compared to the subject property. These characteristics include, but are not limited to, site, room count, gross living area, style, and condition. This does not mean that the comparable must be identical to the subject property, but it should be competitive and appeal to the same market participants that would also consider purchasing the subject property.

Sale activity from within the neighborhood is the best indicator of value as sales prices of comparable properties from the same location should reflect the same positive and negative location characteristics. Fannie Mae does allow for the use of comparable sales that are located in competing neighborhoods, as these may simply be the best comparables available and the most appropriate for the appraiser's analysis. If this situation arises, the appraiser must not expand the neighborhood boundaries just to encompass the comparables selected. The appraiser must indicate the comparables are from a competing neighborhood and address any differences that exist. The appraiser must also provide an explanation as to why they used the specific comparable sales in the appraisal report and include a discussion of how a competing neighborhood is comparable to the subject neighborhood."}

In some situations, sales of properties that are not truly comparable may simply be the best available and the most appropriate for the appraiser's analysis. The use of such sales is acceptable as long as the appraiser adequately documents the analysis and explains why these sales were used. (For additional information, see B4-1.3-03, Neighborhood Section of the Appraisal Report. When describing the proximity of the comparable sale to the subject property, the appraiser must be specific 568 with respect to the distance in terms of miles and include the applicable directional indicator (for example, \u201c1.75 miles NW\u201d).

See Additional Requirements for New (or Recently Converted) Condos, Subdivisions, or PUDs below for exceptions to this policy. In no instance may the appraiser create comparable sales by combining vacant land sales with the contract purchase price of a home (improvements only).

An older sale may be more appropriate in situations when market conditions have impacted the availability of recent sales as long as the appraisal reflects the changing market conditions. Additionally, older comparable sales that are the best indicator of value for the subject property can be used if appropriate. For example, if the subject property is located in a rural area that has minimal sales activity, the appraiser may not be able to locate 3 truly comparable sales that sold in the last 12 months.

Lenders that sell mortgage loans secured by units in a condo, co-op, or PUD project to Fannie Mae are expected to have staff that are knowledgeable about and qualified to evaluate the specific risks presented by these types of projects. The project review is in addition to the review the lender completes for underwriting the borrower, the transaction terms, and the individual unit appraisal."}

Fannie Mae's Project Standards team will determine if a single loan project eligibility waiver is warranted. Fannie Mae charges a nonrefundable $200 review fee for each waiver request. A higher review fee may be charged based on the complexity of the waiver review. Note: Project eligibility waivers are typically issued only for established projects, though Fannie Mae at its sole discretion reserves the right to allow this type of waiver for a unit in a new project on a case- by-case basis. New or newly converted projects must be reviewed for eligibility through an eligible lender review process or by Fannie Mae through the PERS submission process. Lenders must not request a project eligibility waiver for a unit in a new project to circumvent the required review for new projects. Recent Related Announcements"}

Under the UCC, as adopted in almost every state, a lien evidenced on any outstanding certificate of title will have priority over a lien on real property to which the manufactured home is affixed, which is evidenced by a mortgage, deed of trust, or security deed. However, Fannie Mae believes that if a lender follows procedures tailored to take advantage of all protection offered under existing state law-including taking steps to assure that no certificate of title still exists that bears evidence of any lien securing any other loan-sufficient legal protection is afforded.

When a single-closing transaction is used, the lender will be responsible for managing the disbursement of the loan proceeds to the builder, contractor, or other authorized suppliers. Because the loan documents specify the terms of the permanent financing, the construction loan will automatically convert to a permanent long-term mortgage loan upon completion of the construction. Loans that combine construction and permanent financing into a single transaction cannot be purchased by Fannie Mae until the construction is completed and the terms of the construction loan have converted to the permanent financing. Manufactured homes must meet all applicable requirements, including compliance with B5-2-05, Manufactured Housing Legal Considerations. Lenders must use SFC 151 when delivering single-closing construction-to-permanent loans to Fannie Mae (and any other SFCs that may apply to the transaction)."}
