Funds remaining in the Borrower's Escrow account at default must be accounted for with the Servicer's reimbursement request as income to offset expenses. Funds remaining in a temporary buydown account before the foreclosure action was started must be applied as set forth in Section 4204.4. Additionally, the Servicer is required to offset any incurred reimbursable expenses with the proceeds of rental income it receives during the foreclosure or REO holding period. Mortgage insurance premium refunds should be refunded directly to Freddie Mac by the MI on the claim for loss. If, however, the MI sends a refund of the mortgage insurance premium to the Servicer directly, the Servicer must credit the MI premium refund on the claim as income when it submits a request for expense reimbursement."}
