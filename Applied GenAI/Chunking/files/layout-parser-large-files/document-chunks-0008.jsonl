Freddie Mac will then calculate the compensatory fee amount for each individual foreclosure sale to determine whether each Mortgage will result in a compensatory fee or credit. The amounts calculated in this step on an individual foreclosure sale basis will be negative (a credit) for those foreclosure sales that were managed under that State's foreclosure timeline and will be positive (a compensatory fee) for those foreclosure sales that exceeded that State's foreclosure timeline.
