In some jurisdictions, leases that predate the mortgage have a superior claim to the mortgage even if they have not been recorded. Normally, a tenant's rights under a pre-existing lease remain intact on the sale of the leased premises.

Flood insurance coverage is required when a loan is secured by a property located in \u2022 a Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA), or \u2022 a Coastal Barrier Resources System (CBRS) or Otherwise Protected Area (OPA). The lender and servicer must determine whether the property is located in an SFHA, a CBRS, or an OPA by using the FEMA Standard Flood Hazard Determination form. All flood zones beginning with the letter \"A\" or \"V\" are considered SFHAS. Note: If the subject property is located within a CBRS or an OPA, flood insurance is required regardless of whether the property is located in an SFHA. Flood insurance is not required on a principal or residential detached structure securing the loan if the lender or servicer obtains a letter from FEMA stating that its maps have been amended and the structure is no longer in an SFHA."}

The original term of an ARM included in a weighted-average ARM MBS pool must be no more than 30 years.

Lenders participating in a Fannie Majors pool receive an MBS representing its share of the pool in proportion to the dollar amount of mortgages it Published September 4, 2024 992 contributed to the pool.\n\n# Obtaining Fannie Majors Pool Numbers\n\nThe pool number identifies the pools in which a lender's loans are included. Fannie Mae assigns Fannie Majors pool numbers based on loan term, pass-through rate, and the month of issuance. Pool numbers, CUSIP numbers, and pass-through rates are posted on the Fannie Majors page on Fannie Mae's website and on the various wire services."}

To be eligible for a Fannie Majors pool, mortgages may be no older than 11 months as of the security issue date. For example, all loans to be included in a December 2019 pool, must have first payment dates on or after January 2019. As with single-lender, fixed-rate MBS pools, the minimum and maximum allowable interest rate within a Fannie Majors pool is 25 basis points (.25%) and 112.5 basis points (1.125%) respectively above the pool's pass- through rate. Lenders can use loan-level buyups and buydowns to eliminate excess servicing and, in the case of buydowns, include loans in a higher coupon."}

If multiple trades are executed against a single pool transmission, the delivery variance applies to each trade. Lenders that need a higher or lower variance in some situations should contact the Capital Markets Pricing and Sales Desk to negotiate an alternative variance.

Also, no variance is allowed for transactions in which the seller provides the buyer with a pool number and specific original face amount on the date the two parties agree to enter into the transaction.

If the lender owes Fannie Mae pair-off funds from two or more related buy and sell transactions that settle on the same day, it should remit a single wire for the net amount due to Fannie Mae.

Targeted areas may include the following: 1034 \u2714 Fannie Mae \u2022 loans with characteristics related to errors or defects identified in prior prefunding and post-closing review results; \u2022 loans with complex income calculations (for example, rental income, self-employed, short history of receipt of income);"}

Under California law, the term \"settlor\" refers to the individual(s) establishing the trust; therefore, Fannie Mae uses this terminology in the signature forms and in their related instructions. Fannie Mae has also used the term \u201ccredit applicant\" to refer to an individual whose credit is used to qualify for the mortgage. A lender that originates mortgages to inter vivos revocable trusts secured by properties in a state other than California is responsible for making any modifications (including the use of different terminology, if appropriate) needed to conform these signature forms to those that are customary for that state and will be held fully accountable for the use of any invalid signature form(s)."}

(An example is if there is not room for all of the signatures on the note itself.) In these situations, the lender may use a separate attachment or addendum (sometimes referred to as an allonge) for the borrower signatures, so long as the following requirements are met: \u2022 All individual borrower(s) must sign the note itself; lenders may use a signature addendum for trustee signatures.
