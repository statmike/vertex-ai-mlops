Senior Subordinate Mortgages may be incurred either for personal purposes or for business or investment purposes. Thus, Servicers should only file IRS Form 1099-C for discharges of debt in bankruptcy if they are aware that the Borrower is holding the property for investment and not as a Primary Residence or second home, such as in the case of an Investment Property Mortgage, determined at origination. In that case, report debt cancelled for the later of: The year in which the amount of cancelled debt first can be determined, or The year in which the debt is cancelled in bankruptcy\n\n## (ii) Interest\n\nServicers do not need to include interest as part of the cancelled debt in box 2. However, if interest is reported as part of the cancelled debt in box 2, show the interest separately in box 3.\n\n## (iii) Nonprincipal amounts\n\nNonprincipal amounts include penalties, fines, fees and administrative costs.

The Borrower's ownership of the home is jeopardized when he or she stops making monthly payments. Freddie Mac is committed to helping Borrowers find a solution to the Delinquency if they are experiencing financial difficulty in making the Mortgage payment. The Borrower must make a commitment to reduce any discretionary, unnecessary expenditures as a condition of Freddie Mac granting a relief or workout option. Additionally, the Borrower is expected to work out similar relief or workout options with other creditors whenever possible. Freddie Mac recognizes that not every Borrower who is experiencing financial difficulty can retain home ownership. When this is the case, the Servicer can help a Borrower understand the benefits of selling the property to avoid the consequences of foreclosure, where applicable, and the risk of a deficiency judgment.
