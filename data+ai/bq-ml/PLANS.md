# BigQuery ML — Project Plan

## Vision

A hands-on, learn-by-running collection for **BigQuery ML**: training and using machine learning models entirely in SQL with `CREATE MODEL` and the `ML.*` functions. The audience is data practitioners who know SQL and want to do ML where their data already lives — no data movement, no separate training infrastructure.

This is the sibling project to **`../bq-ai-functions/`** (the BigQuery AI/Gemini functions). Where that project is organized **per function** (each function is independent), BigQuery ML is organized around a **model lifecycle**, so the primary unit of content is the **model type**.

Goals:
- One runnable, progressive example per model type, covering the full lifecycle
- Clear coverage of the model-free `ML.*` utility functions (preprocessing, transforms, distance, text)
- End-to-end workflows that compose these into real tasks
- Operationalization patterns (MLOps on BigQuery) via pipelines
- Reference docs (RESOURCES.md) and a map (README.md) kept in sync with the official documentation

---

## Content Architecture

Four top-level content directories. The **unit of content differs by directory** — this is the key design decision.

### 1. `models/` — Per-model-type lifecycle deep dives

One folder per model type. Each folder has `{name}.ipynb` + `{name}.sql`. The notebook walks the **full lifecycle**:

`CREATE MODEL` → `ML.EVALUATE` → (`ML.CONFUSION_MATRIX` / `ML.ROC_CURVE` / etc.) → `ML.PREDICT` (or `ML.FORECAST` / `ML.RECOMMEND`) → `ML.EXPLAIN_PREDICT` / `ML.GLOBAL_EXPLAIN` → `ML.FEATURE_INFO` / `ML.TRAINING_INFO` → hyperparameter tuning (`ML.TRIAL_INFO`)

Model **categories** (imported, remote, export) also live under `models/` because they are variations on how a model is created/stored, not separate concepts.

### 2. `functions/` — Model-free `ML.*` utilities

One folder per function, `{name}.ipynb` + `{name}.sql` — exactly the per-function style used in `bq-ai-functions/`. These are the `ML.*` functions that operate **directly on data without a model** (preprocessing, transforms, distance, text vectorization).

### 3. `workflows/` — Composed end-to-end SQL logic

One notebook per workflow. Combines preprocessing functions + a model lifecycle into a real task (e.g. churn classification end to end). **Workflows = what to do, in SQL (logic).**

### 4. `pipelines/` — Orchestration / MLOps

One folder per orchestration approach. Takes the SQL logic of a workflow and **operationalizes/schedules** it. **Pipelines = how to run it in production (orchestration).** Planned subfolders:
- `sql_scripting/` — multi-statement scripts, `BEGIN/END`, procedures
- `scheduled_queries/` — BigQuery scheduled queries for retrain/score
- `composer_airflow/` — Cloud Composer / Airflow DAGs
- `vertex_kfp/` — Vertex AI Pipelines (KFP)
- `airflow_with_kfp/` — Airflow triggering Vertex Pipelines (combined)

### Supporting files
- `README.md` — the landing-page map (tables + diagram + tree)
- `RESOURCES.md` — the deep per-item reference
- `setup/README.md` — one-stop setup reference (connections, IAM, CREATE MODEL deep dive, quotas, BigFrames)
- `overview.ipynb` — a short interactive tour (one example per category), grown as content is added

---

## Component Details

### Model `.sql` file (in `models/{name}/`)

Progressive, runnable SQL covering the lifecycle. Conventions:
- Header comment block: title, one-line description, the lifecycle order, the dataset used, and doc links
- Each example has a `-- ===` delimiter and a comment header explaining what it demonstrates
- Use placeholders `PROJECT_ID.DATASET` (notebooks substitute real values)
- Examples build up: create → evaluate → inspect → predict → explain → TRANSFORM → tune → cleanup (commented `DROP MODEL`)

### Model `.ipynb` notebook (in `models/{name}/`)

Cell sequence (canonical skeleton — see `models/logistic_regression/` as the reference):
1. **Header** — tracking-pixel + links table (cell 0). Copy from an existing notebook and replace the path/file segments (`bq-ml`, `models/{name}`, `{name}.ipynb`). Path is URL-encoded: `data%2Bai%2Fbq-ml%2Fmodels%2F{name}`.
2. **Overview** — title, a **Lifecycle:** line (the function chain), when-to-use bullets, the dataset, and a **References:** line. Add a **Featured in:** line if any workflow/pipeline uses the model.
3. **Setup** — markdown + config code (PROJECT_ID, LOCATION, DATASET_ID=`bq_ml`) + environment markdown + install code + auth code + client code (creates dataset, loads `bigquery_magics`).
4. **Step N — {lifecycle stage}** — one markdown + code pair per stage. Materialize models with `CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL`; show metrics, predictions, explanations, plots.
5. **Examples — `%%bigquery` Magics** — one representative call.
6. **Examples — BigFrames** — the `bigframes.ml` equivalent (these exist for most model types — e.g. `bigframes.ml.linear_model.LogisticRegression`). **Check parity with the SQL model's options before writing this cell** (e.g. class weighting) — don't assume the BigFrames constructor exposes every `CREATE MODEL` option; verify against the actual installed signature (`inspect.signature(...)`) rather than guessing a parameter name. If no equivalent exists, say so in the markdown rather than silently presenting a mismatched comparison (see `models/boosted_tree_classifier/`: `bigframes.ml.ensemble.XGBClassifier` has no `class_weight` param, unlike `LogisticRegression`).
7. **Cleanup** — drop the models created; a commented-out full-dataset-delete cell. If the notebook exported anything to GCS (tree visualization, etc.), delete those blobs too.

**Convention (decided 2026-06-20, `models/boosted_tree_classifier/`) — visualizing tree-ensemble models:** for any `BOOSTED_TREE_*` / `RANDOM_FOREST_*` notebook, add a step that exports the model (`EXPORT MODEL`) and renders an individual tree with `xgboost.plot_tree()`. Requires a `BUCKET` config variable (alongside `PROJECT_ID`/`LOCATION`/`DATASET_ID`) in the same location as the dataset. Two verified gotchas that MUST be called out in the notebook, not just assumed away:
1. **Pin `xgboost==1.7.6`** (or another pre-2.0 release) in that step's `install()` call — modern xgboost (2.0+) cannot load BQML's exported legacy-binary-format `model.bst`.
2. **Manually reassign `booster.feature_names`** to the training query's non-label `SELECT` column order — the export does not preserve them (`feature_names` loads as `None`).

Rendering also needs the system `graphviz` package (`dot` binary) — pre-installed in Colab; elsewhere `!apt-get install -y graphviz`. Full details in RESOURCES.md's `EXPORT MODEL` entry.

**`RANDOM_FOREST_*`-specific addendum (decided 2026-06-21, `models/random_forest_classifier/`):** do NOT try to render a tree from the notebook's main (full-power) model — verified that a default-settings forest's tree is far too dense (thousands of dump lines, depth 15+) and produces an illegible `xgboost.plot_tree()` image (confirmed even with SVG output). Instead, train a small, separate **illustrative forest** (e.g. `num_parallel_tree=10`, `max_tree_depth=3`) just for the visualization step, clearly labeled as such in the markdown, and drop it in cleanup alongside the other models. This does not apply to `BOOSTED_TREE_*` — its early-round trees are shallow (residual-fitting stages) and render cleanly by default.

### Model-free function `.sql` / `.ipynb` (in `functions/{name}/`)

Same template as `bq-ai-functions/` function notebooks: header → overview (with **Featured in:**) → setup → progressive SQL examples → magics → BigFrames → cleanup.

### Workflow `.ipynb` (in `workflows/{name}/`)

Header → overview (with **Models used:** and **Functions used:** lines) → setup → Step-by-step (data → preprocess → train → evaluate → predict/explain) → interpretation → cleanup.

### Pipeline content (in `pipelines/{approach}/`)

A notebook and/or supporting files (DAG `.py`, KFP component specs) showing how to operationalize a workflow with that orchestrator. Include a **Workflow operationalized:** line linking back to the `workflows/` notebook it schedules.

---

## Sample Data Strategy

Examples must be self-contained and runnable. Prefer **BigQuery public datasets** — no data to load, realistic results.

- **Classification / regression:** `bigquery-public-data.ml_datasets.census_adult_income` (binary label `income_bracket`), `bigquery-public-data.ml_datasets.penguins` (multiclass/regression), `iris`.
- **Clustering:** `penguins`, or any feature-rich public table.
- **Time series:** `bigquery-public-data.new_york_citibike.citibike_trips`, `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.*`, or synthetic series generated with SQL (`GENERATE_DATE_ARRAY` + trend/seasonality). Cross-link to the TimesFM-based `AI.FORECAST` work in `bq-ai-functions/`.
- **Recommendation:** `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample` or MovieLens-style public data.

**Standing practice (carried over from bq-ai-functions):** validate every SQL statement with `bq query` against the real dataset **before** writing it into a notebook cell. Training models in validation is fine (drop them afterward). This catches issues like option requirements (e.g. `enable_global_explain` must be set at `CREATE MODEL` time for `ML.GLOBAL_EXPLAIN`) before a notebook is handed off for Restart & Run All.

---

## Resource Naming Strategy

All notebooks share a single dataset and use `CREATE OR REPLACE` so running them in any order is safe.

### Config variables (every notebook)
```python
PROJECT_ID = 'your-project-id'
LOCATION = 'US'
DATASET_ID = 'bq_ml'          # Shared dataset (configurable, default: bq_ml)
CONNECTION_ID = 'bq_ml'        # Only notebooks that need one (remote/imported models)
BUCKET = 'your-bucket-name'    # Only notebooks that use EXPORT MODEL (e.g. tree visualization) -- same location as DATASET_ID
```
Most BQML model types train on in-BigQuery data and need **no connection**. A connection is only required for **remote models** (Vertex endpoints) and **imported models** (read artifacts from GCS). Those notebooks add `CONNECTION_ID` and create the connection via the `bq` CLI (same pattern as bq-ai-functions, granting the connection SA the needed roles).

**Verified: `EXPORT MODEL` does NOT need a connection** — it only needs GCS write IAM on the credentials running the query (confirmed by testing an export against a `US-CENTRAL1` bucket from a `US` multi-region dataset with no connection object at all). Notebooks that call `EXPORT MODEL` (e.g. tree visualization) add `BUCKET` instead of `CONNECTION_ID`.

### Naming
- **Models / tables:** prefix with the content name, e.g. `logistic_regression_income`, `logistic_regression_income_tuned`, `kmeans_penguins`.
- **GCS (export/import):** `gs://BUCKET/bq_ml/{name}/`.
- All `CREATE OR REPLACE` — idempotent and safe to re-run.

### Cleanup
- **Per-notebook:** drop only the models/tables it created (`DROP MODEL IF EXISTS ...`). Leave the shared dataset.
- **Full:** a commented-out cell at the bottom of every notebook: `DROP SCHEMA \`PROJECT.bq_ml\` CASCADE;` (or `client.delete_dataset(..., delete_contents=True)`).

---

## Cross-Referencing Convention

Bidirectional links help users navigate. Maintain these whenever adding/updating content.

- **Model / function notebooks → consumers:** a **Featured in:** line in the overview cell listing the workflows/pipelines that use it.
- **Workflow / pipeline notebooks → components:** **Models used:** and **Functions used:** lines in the overview cell.
- **Mapping table** (below) records the current state.

### Current mapping

| Content | Type | Featured in |
|---------|------|-------------|
| logistic_regression | model | — (no workflows yet) |
| linear_regression | model | — (no workflows yet) |

## Development Phases

This is the **backlog** — a fresh session can pick the next unchecked item and build it using the templates above.

### Phase 1: Foundation (this bootstrap)
- [x] Folder skeleton (`models/`, `functions/`, `workflows/`, `pipelines/`, `setup/`)
- [x] PLANS.md (this operating manual)
- [x] RESOURCES.md (CREATE MODEL + lifecycle entries; full for logistic regression, stubs + doc links for the rest)
- [x] README.md + setup/README.md
- [x] **Canonical model: `models/logistic_regression/`** (full lifecycle, verified)
- [x] overview.ipynb stub
- [x] Memory entries

### Phase 2: Core supervised models

**Convention (decided 2026-06-20):** when a technique pairs a classifier and a regressor `model_type` (boosted tree, random forest, DNN, wide-and-deep), build **separate folders/notebooks per `model_type`** — mirroring the `models/logistic_regression/` + `models/linear_regression/` precedent — rather than one combined notebook per technique. Each notebook stays tightly focused and matches the canonical skeleton exactly; RESOURCES.md can still document the pair under one combined heading (as it already does for GLM). Folder names follow the `model_type` lowercased (e.g. `BOOSTED_TREE_CLASSIFIER` → `models/boosted_tree_classifier/`).

- [x] `models/linear_regression/` (LINEAR_REG; regression metrics) — built 2026-06-20, `penguins`/`body_mass_g`
- [x] `models/boosted_tree_classifier/` (BOOSTED_TREE_CLASSIFIER, XGBoost) — built + fully verified 2026-06-20, `census_adult_income` (same data/label as `logistic_regression`); includes tree visualization via EXPORT MODEL (Step 7)
- [x] `models/boosted_tree_regressor/` (BOOSTED_TREE_REGRESSOR, XGBoost) — built + fully verified 2026-06-20, `penguins`/`body_mass_g` (same data/label as `linear_regression`); includes tree visualization via EXPORT MODEL
- [x] `models/random_forest_classifier/` (RANDOM_FOREST_CLASSIFIER) — built 2026-06-21, `census_adult_income` (same data/label as `logistic_regression`/`boosted_tree_classifier`); tree visualization uses a dedicated shallow illustrative forest
- [x] `models/random_forest_regressor/` (RANDOM_FOREST_REGRESSOR) — built 2026-06-21, `penguins`/`body_mass_g` (same data/label as `linear_regression`/`boosted_tree_regressor`); genuinely underperforms boosting here (r2≈0.74 vs ≈0.97), discussed honestly in the notebook
- [x] `models/dnn_classifier/` (DNN_CLASSIFIER) — built 2026-07-16, `census_adult_income` (same data/label as `logistic_regression`/`boosted_tree_classifier`/`random_forest_classifier`); DNN training verified dramatically slower than tree models (12-46 min for one CREATE MODEL)
- [x] `models/dnn_regressor/` (DNN_REGRESSOR) — built 2026-07-16, `penguins`/`body_mass_g` (same data/label as `linear_regression`/`boosted_tree_regressor`/`random_forest_regressor`); baseline is badly broken (r2≈-27.5) on this small dataset — fixed with TRANSFORM scaling + a much higher learn_rate (r2≈0.82), discussed honestly as a debugging narrative
- [ ] `models/wide_and_deep_classifier/` (DNN_LINEAR_COMBINED_CLASSIFIER) — stretch goal, may move to a later phase
- [ ] `models/wide_and_deep_regressor/` (DNN_LINEAR_COMBINED_REGRESSOR) — stretch goal, may move to a later phase

### Phase 3: Unsupervised models
- [ ] `models/kmeans/` (KMEANS; `ML.CENTROIDS`, no label)
- [ ] `models/pca/` (PCA; `ML.PRINCIPAL_COMPONENTS`)
- [ ] `models/matrix_factorization/` (recommendation; `ML.RECOMMEND`)
- [ ] `models/autoencoder/` (AUTOENCODER; anomaly/embedding)

### Phase 4: Time series
- [ ] `models/arima_plus/` (ARIMA_PLUS; `ML.FORECAST`, `ML.EXPLAIN_FORECAST`) — cross-link to `bq-ai-functions` AI.FORECAST/TimesFM
- [ ] `models/arima_plus_xreg/` (with external regressors)

### Phase 5: Model categories
- [ ] `models/imported/` (TensorFlow, ONNX, XGBoost via `model_path` + connection)
- [ ] `models/remote/` (`REMOTE WITH CONNECTION` → Vertex AI endpoints) — cross-link to `bq-ai-functions` remote-model pattern (ML.GENERATE_TEXT etc.)
- [ ] `models/export/` (`EXPORT MODEL` to GCS; serve with TF Serving / Vertex)

### Phase 6: Model-free functions
- [ ] Preprocessing: `ML.STANDARD_SCALER`, `ML.MIN_MAX_SCALER`, `ML.MAX_ABS_SCALER`, `ML.ROBUST_SCALER`
- [ ] Bucketizing: `ML.BUCKETIZE`, `ML.QUANTILE_BUCKETIZE`
- [ ] Encoding: `ML.ONE_HOT_ENCODER`, `ML.LABEL_ENCODER`
- [ ] Feature engineering: `ML.FEATURE_CROSS`, `ML.POLYNOMIAL_EXPAND`, `ML.IMPUTER`
- [ ] Distance/vectors: `ML.DISTANCE`, `ML.LP_NORM`
- [ ] Text: `ML.NGRAMS`, `ML.TF_IDF`, `ML.BAG_OF_WORDS`
- [ ] Model-agnostic introspection: `ML.FEATURE_INFO`, `ML.TRAINING_INFO`, `ML.TRIAL_INFO` (also shown inline in model notebooks)

### Phase 7: Workflows
- [ ] End-to-end classification (preprocess → train → evaluate → predict → explain)
- [ ] Customer segmentation (kmeans + feature prep)
- [ ] Demand forecasting (arima_plus)
- [ ] Recommendation (matrix factorization)

### Phase 8: Pipelines (MLOps on BigQuery)
- [ ] `pipelines/sql_scripting/` (multi-statement train+score script / stored procedure)
- [ ] `pipelines/scheduled_queries/` (scheduled retrain + scheduled scoring)
- [ ] `pipelines/composer_airflow/` (Airflow DAG)
- [ ] `pipelines/vertex_kfp/` (Vertex AI Pipeline)
- [ ] `pipelines/airflow_with_kfp/` (Airflow triggering a Vertex Pipeline)

- [ ] `README.md`: Add a row to the Models table; update the diagram if needed
- [ ] Create `models/{name}/` with `{name}.ipynb` (full lifecycle template) + `{name}.sql` (progressive examples)
- [ ] Pre-validate all SQL with `bq query` (train + drop validation models)
- [ ] Cross-reference: add **Featured in:** if used by a workflow/pipeline
- [ ] `PLANS.md`: check the Development Phases item; update the mapping table; add an audit-log entry

#### New model-free function
- [ ] `RESOURCES.md`: Add a full entry in the Model-Free Functions section
- [ ] `README.md`: Add to the Functions table

#### Status / capability change (Preview→GA, new option, new model_type, etc.)
- [ ] Update `RESOURCES.md` entry (status, options, syntax, outputs, limitations)
- [ ] Update `README.md` status labels and tables
- [ ] If it affects a built notebook, revise + re-run (Restart & Run All) before review
- [ ] `PLANS.md`: audit-log entry

### How to run an audit
1. **Prepare** — review the audit log; note Google Cloud Next / release-note announcements since last audit.
2. **Fetch and compare by category** — for each documented item, fetch its doc URL (table below) and compare against `RESOURCES.md`: status, options/parameters, syntax, outputs, limitations, new `model_type` values, new `ML.*` functions.
3. **Classify each change** and apply the relevant checklist above.
4. **Update files in order:** RESOURCES.md entries → RESOURCES.md comparison tables → README.md tables/diagram → PLANS.md (URLs table, mapping, audit log).
5. **Check for new items** — new model types or `ML.*` functions. If docs exist, add full coverage; if only announced, add to Tracked-upcoming.
6. **Verify consistency** — grep status labels across RESOURCES/README/PLANS; confirm the URL table is complete.
7. **Identify notebook impacts** — list notebooks needing a fresh Restart & Run All.

### Audit log

| Date | Scope | Changes |
|------|-------|---------|
| 2026-06-19 | Project bootstrap | Created the bq-ml project parallel to bq-ai-functions: folder skeleton (models/functions/workflows/pipelines/setup), PLANS.md operating manual, RESOURCES.md (CREATE MODEL catalog + lifecycle/model-free/management sections; full entries for logistic regression and the functions it uses, stubs + doc links for the rest), README.md map, setup/README.md. Built the canonical reference model `models/logistic_regression/` (notebook + SQL) on `census_adult_income`, covering CREATE MODEL → ML.EVALUATE → confusion matrix/ROC → ML.PREDICT → ML.EXPLAIN_PREDICT → ML.GLOBAL_EXPLAIN → ML.FEATURE_INFO/TRAINING_INFO → TRANSFORM clause → hyperparameter tuning (ML.TRIAL_INFO) → magics → BigFrames → cleanup. All SQL pre-validated against BigQuery (caught: ML.GLOBAL_EXPLAIN requires enable_global_explain=TRUE at CREATE MODEL time). Backlog for all other models/functions/workflows/pipelines recorded in Development Phases. |
| 2026-06-20 | RESOURCES.md full build (docs-first) | Replaced the stub RESOURCES.md (198 lines) with a comprehensive reference (~4,400 lines) built docs-first via an exhaustive multi-agent research pass (Google Cloud BQML docs as source of truth + this repo's tested notebooks/SQL for real syntax). Locked an entry schema first (per-model-type Template A, per-function Template B) + a scope-boundary policy (cross-link, don't duplicate, bq-ai-functions-owned topics: contribution analysis→AI.KEY_DRIVERS, TimesFM→AI.FORECAST/AI.EVALUATE/AI.DETECT_ANOMALIES, doc processing, LLM text/foundation embeddings, remote-LLM). Coverage: 5 comparison tables (model_type catalog, task→eval metrics, capability matrix, explainability, connection) + full entries for **all** model types (GLM, boosted tree, random forest, DNN, wide-and-deep, AutoML, k-means, PCA, autoencoder, matrix factorization, ARIMA_PLUS, ARIMA_PLUS_XREG, contribution analysis, imported TF/TFLite/ONNX/XGBoost, remote mechanism, transform-only) + all lifecycle functions (EVALUATE/PREDICT/CONFUSION_MATRIX/ROC_CURVE/EXPLAIN_PREDICT/GLOBAL_EXPLAIN/FEATURE_IMPORTANCE/WEIGHTS/ADVANCED_WEIGHTS/FEATURE_INFO/TRAINING_INFO/TRIAL_INFO/CENTROIDS/PRINCIPAL_COMPONENTS/_INFO/RECONSTRUCTION_LOSS/RECOMMEND/GENERATE_EMBEDDING(in-house)/FORECAST/EXPLAIN_FORECAST/ARIMA_EVALUATE/ARIMA_COEFFICIENTS/HOLIDAY_INFO/DETECT_ANOMALIES/TRANSFORM) + model-free families (scalers, bucketizers, encoders, feateng, text, distance, image) + management/monitoring (EXPORT MODEL, DESCRIBE_DATA, VALIDATE_DATA_SKEW/DRIFT, TFDV_DESCRIBE/VALIDATE). Each entry cites a tested repo example where one exists; gaps with no example flagged (ML.RECOMMEND, CONTRIBUTION_ANALYSIS, TF_IDF/BAG_OF_WORDS, image fns, LP_NORM). Research-discovered corrections: `ML.TRANSPOSE` is NOT a real function (it's the TRANSFORM-clause technique); encoder defaults now top_k=32000/frequency_threshold=5. Per-notebook RESOURCES refinement from running code remains the standing practice as notebooks are built. |
| 2026-06-20 | Phase 2: `models/linear_regression/` | Built the second model type: `LINEAR_REG` on `bigquery-public-data.ml_datasets.penguins` (label `body_mass_g`; rows with NULL label or unrecorded `sex` filtered out; 333 clean rows). Notebook + SQL mirror the `logistic_regression` skeleton, swapping classification-only steps (confusion matrix/ROC) for `ML.WEIGHTS` (interpretable regression coefficients — a differentiator from the classifier example). Lifecycle: CREATE MODEL → ML.EVALUATE → ML.PREDICT → ML.EXPLAIN_PREDICT → ML.GLOBAL_EXPLAIN → ML.WEIGHTS → ML.FEATURE_INFO/TRAINING_INFO → TRANSFORM clause → hyperparameter tuning (ML.TRIAL_INFO) → magics → BigFrames → cleanup. All SQL pre-validated end-to-end against BigQuery via `bq query` (confirmed: BQML auto-selects the `NORMAL_EQUATION` solver for this small/unregularized problem — a single closed-form training pass with no `eval_loss`, matching the RESOURCES.md GLM entry's note). Notebook cells built with validated source but not yet executed in a live kernel — needs a Restart & Run All pass to populate outputs before being treated as a second verified canonical reference. |
| 2026-06-20 | RESOURCES.md refinement from running code (task standing practice) | User ran `models/linear_regression/linear_regression.ipynb` (Restart & Run All); reviewing the real outputs against a second independent `bq query` pre-validation run surfaced a genuine, non-obvious BQML gotcha: with the default `category_encoding_method = 'ONE_HOT_ENCODING'`, `ML.WEIGHTS`/`ML.GLOBAL_EXPLAIN` per-category values for a GLM are **not uniquely identified** (one-hot dummies + intercept are collinear) — confirmed by retraining the identical model twice and watching an `island` category's weight swing from +305/+353/+340 to −39/−4/+8.6 between runs (different scale, different sign) while `ML.PREDICT`/`ML.EVALUATE` stayed stable. Fix: `category_encoding_method = 'DUMMY_ENCODING'` pins one baseline category per feature to `weight: 0.0`, making the rest stable, well-defined deltas. Updated `linear_regression.sql`/`.ipynb` (added the option to `CREATE MODEL`, explained why in cell markdown, cleared now-stale outputs pending a fresh Restart & Run All) and `RESOURCES.md` (GLM entry best-practices/limitations, `ML.WEIGHTS` entry best-practices/limitations/repo-example). Also caught and fixed a research-pass citation error: the `ML.WEIGHTS` entry had cited `data+ai/bq-ml/models/logistic_regression/logistic_regression.sql` as a `ML.WEIGHTS` example — that file does not use `ML.WEIGHTS` (only the repo's separate `03a - BQML Logistic Regression.ipynb` does); corrected to cite `linear_regression.sql` instead, which now legitimately demonstrates it. |
| 2026-06-20 | Phase 2: `models/linear_regression/` — final verification | User re-ran the notebook (Restart & Run All) after the `DUMMY_ENCODING` fix. Reviewed all outputs: `ML.WEIGHTS` now shows clean baselines (`species`=Adelie, `island`=Biscoe, `sex`=MALE all pinned to `weight: 0.0`) with stable deltas for every other category; this ties out exactly with `ML.EXPLAIN_PREDICT`, where Adelie-species rows correctly show a `species` attribution of `0.0`. `ML.EVALUATE`'s `r2_score` (0.875223) and all `ML.PREDICT` values are bit-for-bit identical to the pre-fix run, confirming `DUMMY_ENCODING` changed only weight interpretability, not model fit. Noted one more nuance for RESOURCES.md: across 2 independent runs with different random `AUTO_SPLIT`s, `DUMMY_ENCODING`'s dropped baseline category was identical both times and was consistently the *most frequent* category rather than the alphabetically-first one (`sex`: `MALE`, not alphabetically-earlier `FEMALE`, was the baseline both times) — added to the `category_encoding_method` option description. `models/linear_regression/` is now a fully verified second canonical reference alongside `models/logistic_regression/`. |
| 2026-06-20 | Phase 2 backlog: classifier/regressor split convention | Decided the structuring convention for the remaining Phase 2 techniques (boosted tree, random forest, DNN, wide-and-deep — each pairs a classifier + regressor `model_type`): build **separate folders/notebooks per `model_type`**, mirroring the `logistic_regression`/`linear_regression` precedent, rather than one combined notebook per technique. Expanded the Phase 2 backlog from 3 combined bullets to 6 explicit items (`boosted_tree_classifier`/`_regressor`, `random_forest_classifier`/`_regressor`, `dnn_classifier`/`_regressor`) plus 2 stretch items for wide-and-deep. RESOURCES.md continues to document each classifier/regressor pair under one combined heading (as it already does for GLM) — only the notebook/folder structure splits. |
| 2026-06-20 | Phase 2: `models/boosted_tree_classifier/` | Built the third model type: `BOOSTED_TREE_CLASSIFIER` on `bigquery-public-data.ml_datasets.census_adult_income` — deliberately reusing the exact data/label from `models/logistic_regression/` so the two notebooks form a direct "same problem, different technique" comparison (e.g. `roc_auc` side by side). Notebook + SQL mirror the `logistic_regression` skeleton, adding `ML.FEATURE_IMPORTANCE` (tree-specific split-based importance; N/A for GLMs) alongside `ML.GLOBAL_EXPLAIN`, and noting the two can rank features differently (attribution vs. split-based — expected, not a bug). TRANSFORM step uses `ML.QUANTILE_BUCKETIZE` (new preprocessing function for this project, vs. `ML.STANDARD_SCALER` in the GLM notebooks) to also broaden preprocessing-function coverage. Lifecycle: CREATE MODEL → ML.EVALUATE → ML.CONFUSION_MATRIX/ROC_CURVE → ML.PREDICT → ML.EXPLAIN_PREDICT → ML.GLOBAL_EXPLAIN/ML.FEATURE_IMPORTANCE → ML.FEATURE_INFO/TRAINING_INFO → TRANSFORM → HP tuning (ML.TRIAL_INFO) → magics → BigFrames → cleanup. All SQL pre-validated end-to-end against BigQuery via `bq query`. Confirmed a real runtime characteristic worth noting: `ML.TRAINING_INFO` iteration numbering starts at **1** (not 0, as in the GLM notebooks), and the first boosting iteration pays a large one-time data-loading/indexing cost (~14 min observed) before subsequent iterations run in milliseconds — documented in the notebook so it doesn't read as a stall. Also caught during HP-tuning validation: 1 of 6 trials transiently `FAILED` (`error_message = "An internal error happened during trial training."`, `NULL` objective metric) without failing the overall job — documented as a general `ML.TRIAL_INFO` gotcha (not boosted-tree-specific) in both the notebook/SQL and RESOURCES.md's `ML.TRIAL_INFO` entry. Notebook built with validated source but not yet executed live — pending a Restart & Run All pass. |
| 2026-06-20 | Phase 2: `models/boosted_tree_classifier/` — review + tree-visualization add | User ran Restart & Run All; reviewed all outputs (clean, matched pre-validation). Caught and fixed three issues: **(1)** a stale cross-reference — Step 1's markdown pointed to "(Step 8)" for `ML.TRAINING_INFO`, which actually lives in Step 6 (the notebook's Step numbering merges/splits differently than the `.sql` file's Example numbering; the two must each be internally self-consistent, not copied across); **(2)** the BigFrames comparison cell trained a plain `XGBClassifier()` with no class balancing while the SQL model uses `auto_class_weights=TRUE` — verified via `inspect.signature()` that `bigframes.ml.ensemble.XGBClassifier` has **no** `class_weight` parameter at all (unlike `LogisticRegression`, which does), so this is a real, permanent parity gap, not a fixable omission — documented inline rather than silently misleading; **(3)** added a new **Step 7 — Visualize a tree by exporting the model** per the user's suggestion, fully validated end-to-end first (`EXPORT MODEL` → download `model.bst` → load with `xgboost` → `xgboost.plot_tree()`). Verified two real gotchas in the process: exported boosted-tree/random-forest models use XGBoost 0.82's legacy binary format, unreadable by modern xgboost 2.0+ (must pin `xgboost==1.7.6`); and the export does not preserve `feature_names` (reassigned manually from the training query's column order, confirmed correct against actual split thresholds). Added a `BUCKET` config variable. Also corrected a stale, incorrect claim in this file's Resource Naming Strategy section (`EXPORT MODEL` does NOT need a connection — verified by testing; it already correctly said so in RESOURCES.md but this file had drifted). Documented all of this in RESOURCES.md (`EXPORT MODEL` entry, boosted-tree `BigFrames API` line) and as a new standing convention here (tree-ensemble notebooks get a visualization step; BigFrames parity must be checked against the actual installed signature, not assumed). `models/boosted_tree_classifier/` notebook updated with all fixes + the new step; cleared outputs, pending one more Restart & Run All. |
| 2026-06-20 | Phase 2: `models/boosted_tree_classifier/` — final verification | User re-ran the notebook (Restart & Run All) after all fixes. Reviewed every cell, including extracting and visually inspecting the rendered tree PNG from Step 7: it renders correctly with all 11 real feature names, and the run printed the expected `Loading model from XGBoost < 1.0.0` compatibility warning — confirming the `xgboost==1.7.6` pin works exactly as designed against a real (not toy) model. Cleanup deleted all 13 exported model files from GCS. All other steps (evaluate/confusion-matrix/predict/explain/importance/introspect/transform/HP-tuning/magics) matched the prior run's values exactly — boosted trees don't exhibit the GLM one-hot/intercept collinearity instability seen in `linear_regression`. `models/boosted_tree_classifier/` is now a fully verified third canonical reference. |
| 2026-06-20 | Phase 2: `models/boosted_tree_regressor/` | Built the fourth model type: `BOOSTED_TREE_REGRESSOR` on `bigquery-public-data.ml_datasets.penguins` (label `body_mass_g`) — deliberately reusing the exact data/label from `models/linear_regression/` for a direct technique comparison (`r2_score` 0.968 vs. 0.875 on identical data). Notebook + SQL copy the `boosted_tree_classifier` template (incl. the tree-visualization step) with regression-appropriate swaps: no `auto_class_weights` (regression has no class-weighting option), `TRANSFORM` uses `ML.LABEL_ENCODER` (a function not yet demonstrated in a model notebook) instead of `ML.QUANTILE_BUCKETIZE`. All SQL pre-validated end-to-end via `bq query`, including a standalone confirmatory export+load+plot test against the actual trained regressor (not just reusing the classifier's validation) — found one new, regressor-specific nuance: loading the exported booster prints an extra `reg:linear is now deprecated in favor of reg:squarederror` warning (harmless), documented alongside the shared `XGBoost < 1.0.0` warning in RESOURCES.md and the notebook. HP tuning this time had zero failed trials (contrast with `boosted_tree_classifier`'s 1-of-6, reinforcing that the earlier failure was transient/occasional, not systemic). Unlike the BigFrames caveat needed for the classifier, the regressor's BigFrames comparison is genuinely apples-to-apples (no weighting option is used in either the SQL or BigFrames path for regression). Notebook built with validated source; pending user Restart & Run All. |
| 2026-06-21 | Phase 2: `models/boosted_tree_regressor/` — final verification | User re-ran the notebook (Restart & Run All). Reviewed every cell and extracted/visually inspected the rendered tree PNG from Step 6: it matches the standalone pre-validation render exactly (`species<3` → `sex<2` → identical leaf values), and both expected warnings printed on load (`reg:linear` deprecation + `XGBoost < 1.0.0` compatibility). All other steps (evaluate/predict/explain/importance/introspect/transform/magics/BigFrames) matched pre-validation exactly, including the BigFrames step now being genuinely apples-to-apples with the SQL model (identical metrics on both sides — confirms the earlier fix was correct). HP tuning found a notably better model this run (`r2_score` 0.988 at `max_tree_depth=8`, vs. 0.968 in pre-validation) — expected run-to-run variability from random hyperparameter search, not a bug. Also reproducibly observed (both in pre-validation and this run) that `ML.TRAINING_INFO`'s `eval_loss` displays identically to `loss` at every iteration for this small dataset — a benign numerical curiosity, not documented further since it doesn't affect correctness or usage. Cleanup deleted all 8 exported GCS files. `models/boosted_tree_regressor/` is now a fully verified fourth canonical reference. |
| 2026-06-21 | Phase 2: `models/random_forest_classifier/` + `models/random_forest_regressor/` | Built the fifth and sixth model types together: `RANDOM_FOREST_CLASSIFIER` on `census_adult_income` (same data/label as `logistic_regression`/`boosted_tree_classifier`, three-way comparison) and `RANDOM_FOREST_REGRESSOR` on `penguins`/`body_mass_g` (same data/label as `linear_regression`/`boosted_tree_regressor`). Trained both in parallel background jobs to save wall-clock time; random forest trains notably faster than boosted trees (single-pass — ~5-7 min each vs. boosted trees' ~14-23 min) once past the first-job overhead. Three significant, verified findings from this pair: **(1)** `max_iterations` is not a valid `CREATE MODEL` option for `RANDOM_FOREST_*` at all — errors immediately (confirmed via `ML.TRAINING_INFO`: always exactly 1 iteration, `learning_rate=1.0`) — corrected an assumption from initial drafting (first attempt included it and failed). **(2)** A full-power random forest tree is far too dense to visualize (2,435 dump lines, depth 15 on the classifier's default-settings model) — `xgboost.plot_tree()` produces an illegible image even as SVG (which sidesteps the cairo bitmap-size limit but not the density). Fixed by training a small, separate shallow illustrative forest (`num_parallel_tree=10`, `max_tree_depth=3`) dedicated to the visualization step — verified this renders a clean, legible diagram — and recorded as a new standing addendum to the tree-visualization convention (RF-specific; does not apply to `BOOSTED_TREE_*`, whose early trees are naturally shallow). **(3)** On the small 333-row `penguins` dataset, `RANDOM_FOREST_REGRESSOR` genuinely underperforms both `BOOSTED_TREE_REGRESSOR` and `LINEAR_REG` (`r2_score` ≈ 0.74, best-tuned ≈ 0.76, vs. ≈ 0.97 and ≈ 0.88 respectively) — a real, reproducible comparison point (confirmed via HP tuning across a reasonable range), presented honestly in the notebook rather than hidden or hyperparameter-fished away. Also confirmed `bigframes.ml.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier` has no `class_weight` param (same gap as `XGBClassifier`) — same BigFrames caveat applied as `boosted_tree_classifier`. All SQL pre-validated end-to-end via `bq query` for both models including TRANSFORM (`ML.QUANTILE_BUCKETIZE` for classifier, `ML.LABEL_ENCODER` for regressor) and HP tuning (tuning `num_parallel_tree`/`max_tree_depth`). Both notebooks built with validated source; pending user Restart & Run All. |
| 2026-06-22 | Phase 2: `models/random_forest_classifier/` + `models/random_forest_regressor/` — final verification | User ran both notebooks (Restart & Run All), concurrently rather than back-to-back (longer per-cell wall-clock times observed, consistent with shared-project slot contention, not a defect). Reviewed every cell in both, including extracting and visually inspecting both rendered tree PNGs: both illustrative-forest diagrams are clean and legible (no `graph is too large` warning this time, confirming the fix), though the classifier's specific split structure matched an earlier standalone test exactly while the regressor's did not — leading to a new, useful finding (see below). Confirmed both zero-importance features (`island`, `culmen_length_mm`) reproduced exactly on the regressor. HP tuning showed a higher trial-failure rate under concurrent execution (2 of 6 failed on the classifier, vs. 1 of 6 in `boosted_tree_classifier`'s single-notebook run) — consistent with, not contradicting, the documented "occasional transient failure" gotcha. **New finding, and a correction to previously-recorded (but never actually verified) information:** the regressor's tuned model showed **two trials simultaneously marked `is_optimal = TRUE`** (tied `r2_score`) — disproving RESOURCES.md's prior unverified claim that "the smallest `trial_id` wins" implies a single `TRUE` row; corrected to state plainly that ties can produce multiple `TRUE` rows and callers needing exactly one should add an explicit tiebreak. Investigating this also surfaced the root cause of several "close but not bit-identical" values seen throughout this pair's validation and review: **`RANDOM_FOREST_*` retraining is inherently non-deterministic** (default `subsample`/`colsample_bynode` = 0.8, no exposed random seed) — unlike `BOOSTED_TREE_*`, which reproduced almost exactly across separate runs in earlier testing. Documented as a new RESOURCES.md limitation so it isn't mistaken for a bug in future model notebooks. Both `models/random_forest_classifier/` and `models/random_forest_regressor/` are now fully verified fifth/sixth canonical references. |
| 2026-07-16 | Phase 2: `models/dnn_classifier/` + `models/dnn_regressor/` | Built the seventh and eighth model types: `DNN_CLASSIFIER` on `census_adult_income` (same data/label as `logistic_regression`/`boosted_tree_classifier`/`random_forest_classifier`) and `DNN_REGRESSOR` on `penguins`/`body_mass_g` (same data/label as `linear_regression`/`boosted_tree_regressor`/`random_forest_regressor`). Every SQL statement pre-validated end-to-end via `bq query` before writing notebook cells, including several diagnostic runs beyond the final chosen config (documented below). **Major verified findings:** **(1)** DNN training in BigQuery ML is dramatically slower than every tree model built so far — a single baseline `CREATE MODEL` took 12-46 minutes (wall time varied heavily with concurrent BigQuery load in the project from my own parallel validation jobs — consistent with the established slot-contention gotcha, not a new one), for training sets of only ~32K and 333 rows respectively; per-iteration cost itself (~20-45s) is a small fraction of this, implying a large fixed DNN-worker startup cost. **(2)** With default settings (`learn_rate=0.001`, `early_stop=TRUE`) on unscaled numeric features, the classifier still reached a competitive `roc_auc≈0.89` despite `early_stop` cutting training to just 2 iterations, but the regressor was **badly broken** (`r2_score≈-27.5`, worse than predicting the mean) — classification tolerates unscaled inputs far better than regression here. **(3)** Diagnosed the regressor failure directly: `TRANSFORM` + `ML.STANDARD_SCALER` alone (the documented RESOURCES.md best practice) did **not** fix it (`r2_score` still ≈-27.4, verified) — the real binding constraint was `learn_rate` being far too conservative for a 333-row dataset combined with `early_stop`'s default sensitivity (training took only 2 gradient steps total before stopping). Scaling + a 50x higher `learn_rate` (0.05) + more iteration headroom together fixed it: `r2_score≈0.82`. This corrects/refines RESOURCES.md's prior best-practice framing, which implied scaling alone was the key lever. **(4)** HP tuning told two different stories: the classifier's tuning (`num_trials=4`, `HPARAM_RANGE(0.001,0.05)` on `learn_rate` + `HPARAM_CANDIDATES` on `hidden_units`) succeeded cleanly (`roc_auc` 0.895-0.897 across all trials, no failures). The regressor's identical-shape tuning (`HPARAM_RANGE(0.001,0.1)`) completely failed to find the good region — all 4 trials sampled `learn_rate` between 0.001-0.008 and all reproduced the catastrophic `r2_score≈-27`, even though a manually-chosen `learn_rate=0.05` (well within the searched range) fixes it. Presented honestly in the notebook as a real limitation of small tuning budgets, not smoothed over. **(5)** Verified `hidden_units = HPARAM_CANDIDATES([STRUCT([64,32]), STRUCT([32,16])])` is the correct working syntax for the `ARRAY<STRUCT<ARRAY<INT64>>>` tuning shape — RESOURCES.md previously only asserted this was the required type without a tested example. **(6)** Confirmed via the live BigFrames API reference that **no first-class DNN wrapper exists anywhere in `bigframes.ml`** (checked every module: `linear_model`, `ensemble`, `cluster`, `decomposition`, `forecasting`, `imported`, `llm`) — a permanent gap, not a version-specific omission as RESOURCES.md previously hedged. Both notebooks replace the usual BigFrames comparison cell with a markdown note explaining the gap. All validation models dropped after use. Both notebooks built with validated source; pending user Restart & Run All — expect a long wait (see finding 1) and do not run both concurrently with other BigQuery ML work in the same project if avoidable. |
| 2026-07-16 | Phase 2: `models/dnn_classifier/` + `models/dnn_regressor/` — final verification | User ran both notebooks (Restart & Run All). Classifier reviewed cell-by-cell: all metrics matched pre-validation almost exactly (`roc_auc` 0.8929 baseline, 0.8976 best-tuned trial), ROC curve PNG extracted and visually confirmed clean, tuning found no failed trials. **Reviewing the regressor surfaced a real gap in the notebook itself, not just a finding to document:** Step 6 ("the fix") never actually called `ML.EVALUATE` on the fixed model (`dnn_regressor_penguins_transform`) — the notebook asserted `r2_score≈0.82` in its markdown but gave the reader no cell to verify it, only a `ML.PREDICT` cell showing plausible-looking (but not conclusively correct) predictions. Fixed by inserting a `ML.EVALUATE` cell into Step 6 in both `dnn_regressor.ipynb` and `dnn_regressor.sql`, right after the model is created. **Separately, the actual tuning result in this run contradicted the "verified" claim written into Step 7's markdown:** the prior pre-validation run had all 4 tuning trials sample `learn_rate` between 0.001-0.008 and stay stuck at `r2_score≈-27`; this run's tuning (identical SQL, no seed control) had trial 4 sample `learn_rate=0.0275` and reach `r2_score≈0.87` — better than Step 6's hand-picked fix. This means the original claim ("tuning fails to find the good region") was an overgeneralization from a single run, not a reliable property of the config. Corrected the Step 7 markdown in both the notebook and `.sql` file, plus the corresponding RESOURCES.md limitation bullet, to frame this as "small-trial-budget tuning outcomes are not deterministic run-to-run" rather than a fixed failure — backed by both runs' actual `ML.TRIAL_INFO` values. Because the fix was inserted after the run, the new evaluate cell and the corrected markdown still need a fresh run of Step 6 onward (not necessarily a full Restart & Run All, since the kernel can be reused) before `models/dnn_regressor/` can be marked fully verified. `models/dnn_classifier/` is fully verified as-is. **Lesson for future notebooks: when a step's markdown makes a specific quantitative claim about a model's fitness (e.g. "reaches r2_score X"), always include the `ML.EVALUATE` cell needed to let the reader verify that claim themselves — don't rely on `ML.PREDICT` output looking plausible as a substitute.** |
| 2026-07-16 | Phase 2: `models/dnn_regressor/` — Step 6-onward re-run, second correction | User re-ran Step 6 onward after the `ML.EVALUATE` fix above. The new evaluate cell confirmed the fix works (`r2_score=0.8616`, close to the ~0.82 originally claimed). But comparing this run's `ML.TRIAL_INFO` output to the prior full run's revealed the previous correction (logged above, "tuning outcome is not reliable run-to-run") was **itself wrong** — both runs of `dnn_regressor_penguins_tuned` produced **bit-for-bit identical trial hyperparameters** (same 4 `learn_rate` values to 17 significant digits, same optimal trial). The apparent "run-to-run variance" in the prior correction was actually a same-name-vs-different-name artifact: the original comparison was between an ad-hoc `_validate`-suffixed pre-validation model and the real `_tuned` model — two DIFFERENT model names, not two runs of the same one. Corrected the framing a second time, now in the notebook, `.sql`, and RESOURCES.md (both the `DNN_CLASSIFIER`/`DNN_REGRESSOR` entry and the general `ML.TRIAL_INFO` entry): BQML's HP tuning search order appears tied to the model's identity (e.g. resource name) and is reproducible for a fixed name, but not guaranteed to transfer to a differently-named model with the same search config. **Separately, the re-run's `%%bigquery` magics cell failed with a real 404** (`Not found: Model ... dnn_regressor_penguins`) — not a notebook bug, but an artifact of the two-part re-run: the first full run's Cleanup cell already dropped the baseline model, and re-running only Step 6 onward never recreated it before the magics cell (which references the baseline) executed. Resolution: re-run Step 1's cell to recreate the baseline model, then re-run the magics cell, then Cleanup — no notebook code change needed for this part, since a normal single Restart & Run All never hits this (Cleanup only runs after the magics cell). **Lesson: don't generalize a "verified" cross-run finding from comparing two differently-configured/-named models — only compare truly identical reruns (same name, same SQL) when claiming something is or isn't deterministic.** `models/dnn_regressor/` still needs one more clean pass (recreate baseline + re-run magics cell) before final sign-off. |
| 2026-07-16 | Phase 2: `models/dnn_regressor/` — fresh Restart & Run All, third correction, final sign-off | User did a full kernel restart + Restart & Run All (not a partial re-run this time) — the `%%bigquery` magics cell now succeeds since the baseline model exists throughout. Comparing this third independent run's outputs against the prior two revealed the determinism finding is even broader than the second correction stated: **it's not just HP tuning's search order that's reproducible — the entire DNN training process is, for a fixed model name.** The baseline model's `ML.EVALUATE` (`r2_score = -27.351799`) and `ML.TRAINING_INFO` loss curve matched bit-for-bit across all three runs; the scaled+higher-learn-rate fix model's `ML.EVALUATE` (`r2_score = 0.861626`) matched bit-for-bit across its two runs. This meant Step 6's markdown claim of "~0.82" (from my original ad-hoc, differently-named pre-validation model) was itself an apples-to-oranges artifact, same mistake pattern as the tuning correction — the real, reproducible number under the actual notebook's model name is 0.861626, not ~0.82. Corrected the specific number (~0.82 → 0.86) and broadened the determinism framing in the notebook (Step 6 markdown, the new evaluate cell's comment, the top overview cell), `.sql`, and RESOURCES.md (both the DNN limitations/best-practices bullets and the general `ML.TRIAL_INFO` entry) to state plainly: DNN training under a fixed `CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL` name reproduces bit-for-bit (evaluation metrics, loss curves, and tuning trials all included) — a different model name is not guaranteed to follow the same trajectory. All other cells reviewed clean, no errors, tuned model's `is_optimal` trial confirmed the known-good `learn_rate≈0.0275` result a third time. `models/dnn_regressor/` and `models/dnn_classifier/` are both now fully verified seventh/eighth canonical references. **Standing lesson reinforced twice in one notebook: verify "run-to-run" claims by comparing the SAME model name across runs — comparing a throwaway `_validate`-suffixed pre-validation model against the real notebook model is not a valid same-config comparison, even when the SQL and options otherwise match.** |
