    "Where a model gets trained is where it consumes computing resources.  With Vertex AI, you have choices for configuring the computing resources available at training.  This notebook is an example of an execution environment.  When it was set up there were choices for machine type and accelerators (GPUs).  \n",

The model was then imported to Vertex AI and deployed to an endpoint for online predictions. \n",

For that reason, the first step is creating a Dockerfile for the workflow and storing it in GCS. The next step is running Cloud Build and using the client to specify the Build config rather than a config file.  The steps of the build config start with getting the code (git clone, or copy from GCS) and copying the Dockerfile.  \n",

    "There are many workflows for creating containers with ML training code.  Many of the most common ones are explored in the tips notebook [Python Custom Containers](../Tips/Python%20Custom%20Containers.ipynb).  The method used here is the simplest - copy the training code directly into the container.  The other methods include packaging the training code as a Python Distribution and using `pip install` in from GCS, GitHub and even Artifact Registry as a private repository."
