# Vertex AI for Machine Learning Operations

>**2025 UPDATE:** The repository is progressing toward an MLOps focused approach for predictive and generative AI operations.
>
>The main focus of the repository is new content developed in:
>- MLOps
>- Frameworks
>- Applied *
>   - mostly Applied GenAI and Applied Forecasting
>
>What to expect in 2025:
>- Much more MLOps content in the `/MLOps` folder
>- A detailed review of GenAI tooling in the `Applied GenAI` folder
>- Many framework specific workflows in the `Frameworks` folder
>- Migration of all the numbered folders to these main folders
>- Collapsing all the Applied * folders into a single 'Applied Workflows' folder with subfolders by topic: GenAI, Forecasting, ...
>- A complete rewrite of this readme.md file
>- Content that is deemed stale is moved into subfolders named `legacy` and links from/to are updated.

>**2024 UPDATE:**  This repository is evolving from end-to-end workflows for various frameworks into an MLOps focused approach for development of predictive and generative AI operations.  The new approach is being developed in the [MLOps](./MLOps/readme.md) folder.  Once it nears completion, the content in this repository will be rearranged into the following structure:
>- MLOps
>    - Pipelines
>    - Experiments
>    - Feature Store
>    - Model Monitoring
>    - ...
>- Applied Examples
>    - Forecasting
>    - GenAI
>    - ...
>- Framework Workflows
>    - BigQuery ML
>    - TensorFlow
>    - scikit-learn
>    - ...
> - ...

> This is the original readme from prior to the shift in this repository.  After the content rearrangement is complete and this information is incorporate above it will be removed.  

## ðŸ‘‹ I'm Mike

I want to share and enable [Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/start/introduction-unified-platform) from [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai) with you.  The goal here is to share a comprehensive set of end-to-end workflows for machine learning that each cover the range of data to model to serving and managing - even automating the flow.  Regardless of your data type, skill level or framework preferences you will find something helpful here.  You can even ask for what you need and I might be able to work it into updates!

## Tracking

To better understand which content is most helpful to users, this repository uses tracking pixels in each markdown (`.md`) and notebook (`.ipynb`) file.  **No user or location data is collected.**  The only information captured is that the content was rendered/viewed which gives us a daily count of usage.  Please share any concerns you have with this in [repositories discussion board](https://github.com/statmike/vertex-ai-mlops/discussions) and I am happy to also provide a branch without the tracking.  

A script is provided to remove this tracking from your local copy of this repository in the file `pixel_remove.py` in the folder [pixel](./architectures/tracking/setup/pixel/readme.md).  This readme also has the complete code for creating the tracking in case you want to use replicate it or just understand it in greater detail.

## Approach Used In This Repository

This repository is presented as workflows using, primarily, interactive python notebooks `.ipynb`.  Why?  These are easy to review, share, and move.  They contain elements for both code and narrative. The narrative can be written with plain text, Markdown and/or HTML which makes providing visual explanations easy.  This reinforces the goal of this repository: information that is easily accessible, portable, and great for starting points in your own work.

In notebooks, execution is driven from the locally attached compute.  In this repository that means the Python code is currently running in the notebooks compute.  The code in this repository heavily leans on orchestrating services in GCP rather than doing data compute in the local environment to the notebook.  That means these notebooks are designed to run on minimal machine sizes, like `n1-standard2` even.  The heavy work of training and serving is done on Vertex AI, BigQuery, and other Google Cloud services.  You will even find notebooks that author code, and then deploy the code in services like Vertex AI Custon Training and Vertex AI Pipelines.  

There are sections that use other languages, like R, as well as creating files that are external to the notebooks: `dockerfile`, `.py` scripts and modules, etc.

The code in this repository is opinionated.  It is not completely production ready as well as not simply ad-hoc exploration.  It aims to the right of the continum of exploration to deployment: 'hello-world' to CI/CD/CT.  In our data science daily work we might think of the process as:

<p align="center" width="100%"><center>
    <img src="./architectures/architectures/images/readme/code_progression.png">
</center></p>

In **explore**, everything is code as you go.  At some point in this exploration ideas find value and need to be developed.

In **develop**, the approach is usually something like:
- make it work
    - get a working end to end flow
- clean it up
    - revisit the code and remove parts that are no longer needed and reorder based on what is learned
- generalize it
    - parameterize
    - use functions
    - control flow: start using logic to check for out of bound conditions
- optimize it
    - better use of data structures to handle data usage during execution
    - consider execution timing and optimize for the simoultaneous goal of readability (= maintainability) and compute time

In many cases, getting from development to **deployment** is simple:
- schedule a notebook - a lot like skipping the **develop** stage
- deploy a pipeline
- create a cloud function

But, inevitably, as a workflow proves value it requires more effort before you **deploy**:
- error handling
- unit testing
- move from specialized code to generalized code: 
    - use classes
    - control environment handling

So where does the code in the repository fall? In the late **develop** phase with strong readability and adaptibility.

## Overview

This is a series of workflow demonstrations that use the same data source to build and deploy the same machine learning model with different frameworks and automation.  These are meant to help get started in understanding and learning Vertex AI and provide starting points for new projects.  

The demonstrations focus on workflows and don't delve into the specifics of ML frameworks other than how to integrate and automate with Vertex AI. Let me know if you have ideas for more workflows or details to include!

To understand the contents of this repository, the following charts uncover the groupings of the content.

## Interacting with Vertex AI
Many Vertex AI resources can be viewed and monitored directly in the [GCP Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai).  Vertex AI resources are primarily created, and modified with the [Vertex AI API](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/reference).  

The API is accessible from:
- the command line with [`gcloud ai`](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/ai), 
- [REST](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/reference/rest),
- [gRPC](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/reference/rpc), 
- or the [client libraries](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/start/client-libraries) (built on top of gRPC) for
    - [Python](https://cloud.google.com/python/docs/reference/aiplatform/latest), 
    - [Java](https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/reference/google-cloud-aiplatform/latest/overview), and 
    - [Node.js](https://cloud.google.com/nodejs/docs/reference/aiplatform/latest).  

The notebooks in this repository primarily use the Python client `aiplatform`.  There is occasional use of `aiplatform.gapic`,  `aiplatform_v1` and `aiplatform_v1beta1`.

For the full details on the APIs versions and layers and how/when to use each, [see this helpful note](./Tips/aiplatform_notes.md).

**Install the Vertex AI Python Client**
```python
pip install google-cloud-aiplatform
```

**Example Usage: Listing all Models in Vertex AI Model Registry**
```python
PROJECT = 'statmike-mlops-349915'
REGION = 'us-central1'

# List all models for project in region with: aiplatform
from google.cloud import aiplatform
aiplatform.init(project = PROJECT, location = REGION)

model_list = aiplatform.Model.list()
```

## Setup

The demonstrations are presented in a series of notebooks that are best run in JupyterLab. These can be reviewed directly in [this repository on GitHub](https://github.com/statmike/vertex-ai-mlops) or cloned to your Jupyter instance on [Vertex AI Workbench Instances](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/workbench/instances/introduction).

### Option 1: Review And Use Individual Files

Select the files and review them directly in the browser or IDE of your choice.  This can be helpful for general understanding and selecting sections to copy/paste to your project.  Some options to get a local copy of this repositories content:
- use git: `git clone https://github.com/statmike/vertex-ai-mlops`
- use `wget` to copy individual files directly from GitHub:
    - Go to the notebook on GitHub.com and right-click the download link. Then select copy link address.
    - Alternatively, click the Raw button on GitHub and then copy the URL that loads.
    - Run the following from a notebook cell or directly from a terminal (without the !). Note the slightly different address that points directly to raw content on GitHub.
        - `!wget "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/statmike/vertex-ai-mlops/main/<path and filename>.ipynb"`
- Use [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) (and soon [Vetex AI Enterprise Colab](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/colab/create-console-quickstart)) to open the notebooks. Many of the notebooks have section at the top with buttons for opening directly in Colab.  Some notebooks don't yet have this feature and some use local Docker which is not available on Colab.  

### Option 2: Run These Notebooks in a Vertex AI Workbench based Notebook
