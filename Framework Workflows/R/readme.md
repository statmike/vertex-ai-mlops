This series of notebooks will cover workign with [R](https://www.r-project.org/) in Vertex AI.


**Workflows:**

This repository also has a series of notebook based workflows for R that can be reviewed here: [../../08 - R](../../08%20-%20R/readme.md).  These workflows will be reviewed, updated, and migrated to this folder in the coming months.

- [R on Vertex AI Pipelines](./R%20on%20Vertex%20AI%20Pipelines.ipynb)
    - Read more about Vertex AI Pipelines in this repositories [MLOps](../../MLOps/readme.md) section, specifically the [Orchestration With Pipelines](../../MLOps/Pipelines/readme.md) content.
    - While pipelines are compiled KFP or TFX code which originates in Python it is possible to create container based components with KFP
    - This workflow shows how to use a pre-built container that has R on it to easily run an R script by providing minimal inputs:
        - The text of the R script
        - A list of required libraries to run the script.  It will automatically make sure the packages are installed.
        - A list of arguments to pass to the script when it runs.
        - An output path in GCS that will be available to the R script as a local enviroment variable named `AIP_MODEL_DIR` similar to how Vertex AI Custom Training Jobs work.
    - The simple pipeline runs on Vertex AI with the permission of the provided service account which means the R script can interact with GCP services.  The example script used in this notebook:
        - Reads data from Google Cloud BigQuery
            - the project, dataset, and table are provided as command line arguments created from the pipeline inputs
            - the variables to exclude and the split of data to read are provided as commoand line arguments created from the pipeline inputs
        - Builds a GLM model in R
            - The target variable name is provided as a command line argument created from the pipeline inputs
        - Saves the resulting model as `model.rds`
        - Stores the `model.rds` folder in GCS at the location provided as an input to the pipeline.
