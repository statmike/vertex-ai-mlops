    "# BigQuery ML (BQML) - AutoML For Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, BigQuery ML (BQML) is used to create an [AutoML classification model](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery-ml/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-create-automl).\n",
    "\n",
    "**AutoML**\n",
    "\n",
    "BigQuery ML can directly use the [Vertex AI AutoML](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/beginner/beginners-guide) service to train a model on [tabular data](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/tabular-data/overview) - specifically a [classification model](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/tabular-data/classification-regression/overview).  This service will try multiple model types, automatically do hyperparameter turning as well as ensemble multiple models in order to create a reliable machine learning model.  As a user, the main inputs are the training data and a budget for how long the service will work on the model training. \n",
    "\n",
    "**BigQuery ML (BQML)**\n",
    "\n",
    "BigQuery has a number of machine learning algorithms callable directly from SQL.  This gives the convenience of using the common language of `SQL` with statments like `CREATE MODEL …`.  The library of available models is constantly growing and covers supervised, unsupervised, and time series methods as well as functions for evaluation - even anomaly detection from results, explainability and hyperparameter tuning.  A great starting point for seeing the scope of available methods is the [user journey for models](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery-ml/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-e2e-journey).\n",
    "\n",
    "**BigQuery ML Locations**\n",
    "An important consideration for BigQuery ML algorithms is the location of the training data.  BigQuery ML Model Type availability differes by region and can be referenced [here](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery-ml/docs/locations).\n",
    "\n",
    "**BigQuery ML and Slot Usage**\n",
    "The BigQuery ML `CREATE MODEL` statement triggers a BigQuery job that is one of two types: `QUERY` or `ML_EXTERNAL`.  Some model types train inside BigQuery (`QUERY`) and others leverage Vertex AI resources (`ML_EXTERNAL`).  With on-demand usage (the default) of BigQuery, each of these model types executes with the exception of `model_type = 'MATRIX_FACTORIZATION'`.  With flat-rate pricing, the reservation associated with the project will need to account for the job type of `ML_EXTERNAL` for models that train externally.\n",
    "- More details on [BigQuery ML pricing](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/pricing#bqml).\n",
    "- Note that all model evaluation and prediction functions in BigQuery use the standard `QUERY` job type and pricing\n",
