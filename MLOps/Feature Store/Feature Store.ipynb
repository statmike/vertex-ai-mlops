    "In ML, instances (think rows) of data are used to both train models, and request predictions.  The transformation of the colomns in these instances into features by feature engineering is essential for input at training and serving.  Thus, feature management is important.\n",
    "\n",
    "A feature store centralizes the tasks of creating, maintaining, sharing, and serving ML features.  This allows for easier reuse, faster ML development, less training/serving skew, and discoverability of features and feature sets.\n",

    "The main layout for Feature Store is serving environment for **features** observed on **entities**:\n",
    "- **entity** = a unique record, think row\n",
    "- **feature** = observations, input for ML, think column\n",
    "\n",
    "The **offline store** is made up of any BigQuery Table(s)/View(s), the **data source**, that you manage:\n",
    "- (1) If a table/view has a single row per unique **entity** with columns that are non-changing values for **features** then the table can be directly used in an **online store's** **feature view** (see below).\n",
    "- (2) For time bound **features** the table/view needs to have two additional columns: entity_id, feature_timestamp. Think of this as a history table.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **feature registry**:\n",
    "- Tables/Views of type (2) above are registered as **Feature Groups** - a feature group is sourced by a single table/view\n",
    "- Columns from the **feature group** are then registered as **features**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **online store** is has two types to choose from:\n",
    "- Cloud Bigtable online serving - highly scalable\n",
    "- Optimized online serving - ultra-low latencies and responsive to burst of requests\n",
    "\n",
    "**Feature Views** are created in the **online store** from either:\n",
    "- Features from one or more **feature groups**\n",
    "- a table/view of type (1) above\n",
    " \n",
    "BigQuery as a **data source**:\n",
    "- This means that managing time bound **features** is done in BigQuery but before the **feature store**.  You can create multiple rows per **entity** in tables and use the entity_id and feature_timestamp columns to indicate the time based values. To make this shape of source data useful for training data batches (or evaluation, test, batch prediction) there are two new functions in BigQuery to help extract point-in-time value for **entity/feature** data:\n",
    "    - [ML.FEATURES_AT_TIME](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-feature-time) - will take a table and timestamp as input and return the value for each feature on each entity as of the timestamp.  There are additional optional configurations also.  \n",
    "    - [ML.ENTITY_FEATURES_AT_TIME](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-entity-feature-time) - will take a input table and an additional table of entity+timestamp pairs and return the feature values for each entity+timestamp pair.  This allows both multiple points in time for single entities as well as different times for different entities.\n",
    "- Time bound data, or column values that change for a row/entity, might not be the native way data scientist are used to working with data.  There are great features in BigQuery to help with handling data that changes with time.\n",
    "    - Creating these tables/views with timestamp entity records may be benefited by [time-travel](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/time-travel#time_travel) (up to 7 days - configurable) and [snapshots](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/table-snapshots-intro) (user controlled points in time).

    "In some cases, doing all the tasks concurrently can work. Usually, there are limitations though. Waiting on a API to respond does not put a burden on the local compute so managing lots of requests may not be an issue on the client side.  It can still be helpful to limits to concurrency for managing the requests.  A first step to limiting concurrency is using a tool like [asyncio.Semaphore](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-sync.html#semaphore) to managed a counter of current concurrent requests.\n",
