# Orchestration With Pipelines
> You are here: `vertex-ai-mlops/MLOps/Pipelines/readme.md`

The workflow of ML code does many steps in sequence.  Some of the steps involve conditional logic like deploying the new model only when it is more accurate than the currently deployed model.  This is a pipeline.  Pipelines are essential for turning ML processes into MLOps.  MLOps goes the next mile with automation, monitoring, and governing the workflow.

There are frameworks for specifying these steps like [Kubeflow Pipelines (KFP)](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/pipelines/v2/introduction/) and [TensorFlow Extended (TFX)](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/guide/understanding_tfx_pipelines).  [Vertex AI Pipelines](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/pipelines/introduction) is a managed service that can execute both of these.
- The [history of Kubeflow](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/started/introduction/#history) is creating a simplified way for running TensorFlow Extended jobs on Kubernetes.

## Introduction

Pipelines are constructed of:
1. Create **Components** From Code
2. Construct **Pipelines** Where steps, or **Tasks**, are made from components
3. **Run** Pipelines on Vertex AI Pipelines
4. Review pipelines runs and **tasks results**
5. Review task **Execution**: Each task runs as a Vertex AI Training Custom Job

<a id='workflow-2'></a>
## Components

The steps of the workflow, an ML task, are run with components. Getting logic and code into components can consists of using prebuilt components or constructing custom components:
- KFP
    - Pre-Built:
        - [Google Cloud Pipeline Components](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/pipelines/gcpc-list)
            - [GitHub](https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/blob/master/components/google-cloud/README.md)
    - Custom:
        - [Lightweight Python Components](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/pipelines/v2/components/lightweight-python-components/) - create a component from a Python function
        - [Containerized Python Components](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/pipelines/v2/components/containerized-python-components/) - for complex dependencies
        - [Container Component](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/pipelines/v2/components/container-components/) - a component from a container
- TFX
    - Pre-Built:
        - [TFX Standard Components](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/guide#tfx_standard_components)
        - [Community-developed components](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/addons)
    - Custom:
        - [Python function-based components](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/guide/custom_function_component) - create a component from a Python function
        - [Container-based components](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/guide/container_component) - a component from a contaienr
        - [Fully custom components](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/guide/custom_component) - reuse and extend standard components.

<div><table style='text-align:left;vertical-align:middle;background-color: #4285F4' width="100%" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0"><tr><td markdown="block">

**Notebook Workflow:**

For an overview of components from custom to pre-built, check out this notebook:
- [Vertex AI Pipelines - Components](./Vertex%20AI%20Pipelines%20-%20Components.ipynb)
    - **Pre-Built Components:** Easy access to many GCP services
    - **Lightweight Python Components:** Build a component from a Python function
    - **Containerized Python Components:** Build an entire Python enviornment as a component
    - **Container Components:** Any container as a component
    - **Importer Components:** Quickly import artifacts

</td></tr></table></div>

**Compute Resources** For Components:

Running pipleines on Vertex AI Pipelines runs each component as a Vertex AI Training `CustomJob`.  This defaults to a vm based on `e2-standard-4` (4 core CPU, 16GB memory).  This can be modified at the task level of pipelines to choose different computing resources, including GPUs.  For example:

```Python
@kfp.dsl.pipeline()
def pipeline():
    task = component().set_cpu_limit(C).set_memory_limit(M).add_node_selector_constraint(A).set_accelerator_limit(G).
```
Where the inputs are defining [machine configuration for the step](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/pipelines/machine-types):
- C = a string representing the number of CPUs (up to 96).
- M = a string represent the memory limit.  An integer follwed by K, M, or G (up to 624GB).
- A = a string representing the desired GPU  or TPU type
- G = an integer representing the multiple of A desired.

## Component IO

Getting information into code and results out is the IO part of components.  These inputs and outputs are particularly important in MLOps as they are the artifacts that define an ML system: datasets, models, metrics, and more.  Pipelines tools like TFX and KFP go a step further and automatically track the inputs and outpus and even provide lineage information for them.  Component inputs and outputs can take two forms: parameters and artifacts.  

**Parameters** are Python objects like `str`, `int`, `float`, `bool`, `list`, `dict` objects that are defined as inputs to pipelines and components. Components can also return parameters for input into subsequent components. Paramters are excellent for changing the behavior of a pipeline/component through inputs rather than rewriting code.
- [KFP Parameters](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/pipelines/v2/data-types/parameters/)
- [TFX Parameters](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/guide/understanding_tfx_pipelines#parameter)

**Artifacts** are multi-parameter objects that represent machine learning artifacts and have defined schemas and are stored as metadata with lineage.  The artifact schemas follow the [ML Metadata (MLMD)](https://github.com/google/ml-metadata) client library.  This helps with understanding and analyzing a pipeline.
- [KFP Artifacts](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/pipelines/v2/data-types/artifacts/)
    - provided [artifact types](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/pipelines/v2/data-types/artifacts/#artifact-types)
    - [Google Cloud Artifact Types](https://google-cloud-pipeline-components.readthedocs.io/en/google-cloud-pipeline-components-2.0.0/api/artifact_types.html)
- [TFX Artifacts](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/guide/understanding_tfx_pipelines#artifact)

<div><table style='text-align:left;vertical-align:middle;background-color: #4285F4' width="100%" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0"><tr><td markdown="block">

**Notebook Workflow:**

See all the types of parameters and artifacts in action with the following notebook based workflow:
- [Vertex AI Pipelines - IO](./Vertex%20AI%20Pipelines%20-%20IO.ipynb)
    - **parameters:** input, multi-input, output, multi-output
    - **artifacts:** input, output, Vertex AI ML Metadata Lineage

</td></tr></table></div>


<a id='workflow-5'></a>
**Secure Parameters:** Passing credentials for an API or service can expose them.  If these credentials are hardcoded then they can be discovered from the source code and are harder to update.  A great solution is using [Secret Manager](https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager/docs/create-secret-quickstart#secretmanager-quickstart-console) to host credentials and then pass the name of the credential as a parameter.  The only modification needed to a component is to use a Python client to retrieve the credentials at run time.  

<div><table style='text-align:left;vertical-align:middle;background-color: #4285F4' width="100%" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0"><tr><td markdown="block">

**Notebook Workflow:**

Check out how easy secret manager isis to implement with the following notebook based example workflow:
- [Vertex AI Pipelines - Secret Manager](./Vertex%20AI%20Pipelines%20-%20Secret%20Manager.ipynb)
    - **Setup** Secret Manager and use the console and Python Client to store secrets
    - **Retrieve** secrets using the Python Client
    - **example** pipeline that retrieves credentials from Secret Manager

</td></tr></table></div>


<a id='workflow-11'></a>
**GCS Read/Write:** Methods for reading and writing data in GCS within a component.  Components run as Vertex AI Training jobs which include GCS as a Fuse mount.  That means components can utlizes GCS at the `/gcs` mount during runs.  This include container components and the notebook workflow below even shows how to pass code directly to a container for execution.

<div><table style='text-align:left;vertical-align:middle;background-color: #4285F4' width="100%" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0"><tr><td markdown="block">

**Notebook Workflow:**
 
Use the `/gcs` mount point to easily read and write data to GCS without need any library imports or setup.  The pipeline runs as a service account on a network and any bucket that can be reached with this setup is automatically available.
- [Vertex AI Pipelines - GCS Read and Write](./Vertex%20AI%20Pipelines%20-%20GCS%20Read%20and%20Write.ipynb)

<a id='workflow-4'></a>
## Control Flow For Pipelines

As the task of an ML pipeline run they form a graph.  The outputs of upstream components become the inputs of downstram components.  Both TFX and KFP automatically use these connection to create a DAG of execution.  When logic needs to be specified in the pipeline flow of execution the use of control structures is necessary.  

<div><table style='text-align:left;vertical-align:middle;background-color: #4285F4' width="100%" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0"><tr><td markdown="block">

**Notebook Workflow:**

The following notebook shows many examples of implement controls in KFP while running on Vertex AI Pipelines:
- [Vertex AI Pipelines - Control](./Vertex%20AI%20Pipelines%20-%20Control.ipynb)
    - **Ordering**: DAG and Explicit ordering
    - **Conditional Execution**: if, elif (else if), and else
        - **Collecting**: Conditional results
    - **Looping**: And Parallelism
        - **Collecting**: Looped Results
    - **Exit Handling:** with and without task failures
    - **Error Handling** continue execution even after task failures

</td></tr></table></div>

---
<a id='workflow-6'></a>
## Scheduling Pipelines

Pipelines can be run on a schedule directly in Vertex AI without the need to setup a scheduler and trigger (like PubSub).  

<div><table style='text-align:left;vertical-align:middle;background-color: #4285F4' width="100%" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0"><tr><td markdown="block">

**Notebook Workflow:**

Here is an example of a pipeline run followed by a schedule that repeats the pipeline at a specified interval the number of iterations set as the maximum on the schedule:

- [Vertex AI Pipelines - Scheduling](./Vertex%20AI%20Pipelines%20-%20Scheduling.ipynb)
    - **Create**
    - **Retrieve**
    - **Manage**

</td></tr></table></div>

This can have many helpful applications, including:
- Running Batch predictions, evaluations, monitoring each day or week
- Retraining a model, do evaluations, and comparing the new model to the currently deployed model then conditionally updating the deployed model
- Check for new training records and commence with retraining if conditions are met - like records that increase a class by 10%, atleast 1000 new records, ....

---
<a id='workflow-9'></a>
## Notifications From Pipelines

As the number of pipelines grow and the use of schedulinng and triggering is implemented it becomes necessary to know which pipelines need to be reviewed.  Getting notificaitons about the completion of pipeliens is a good first step.  Then, being able to control notificaitons to only be sent on failure or particular failures becomes important.

<div><table style='text-align:left;vertical-align:middle;background-color: #4285F4' width="100%" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0"><tr><td markdown="block">

**Notebook Workflow:**

This notebook workflow covers pre-built components for email notification and building a custom notification system for send emails (or tasks) conditional on the pipelines status.

## Managing Pipelines: Storing And Reusing Pipelines & Components

As seen above, pipelines are made up of steps which are executions of components.  These components are made up of code, container, and instructions (inputs and outputs).  

**Components:**

For each type of component, `kfp` compiles the component into YAML as part of the pipeline.  You can also directly compile individual components.  This makes the YAML for a component a source that can be managed.  And using this in additional pipelines is made possible with `kfp.components.load_component_from_*()` which has version for files, urls, text (strings).

**Pipelines:**

Pipelines are compiled into YAML files that include component specifications.  Managine these pipelines files as artifacts is made easy with the combination of:
- Kubeflow Pipelines SDK and the included [`kfp.registry.RegistryClient`](https://kubeflow-pipelines.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/registry.html)
- Google Cloud [Artifact Registry](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/overview) with native format for [Kubeflow pipeline templates](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/kfp)
- [Integration with Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/pipelines/create-pipeline-template#kubeflow-pipelines-sdk-client) for creating, uploading and using pipeline templates

## Managing Pipeline Jobs

Vertex AI Pipeline Jobs are runs of a pipeline.  These can be directly run by a user, started by API, or scheduled.  Withing Vetex AI a project can have many jobs running at any time and a history of all past jobs.  This workflow shows how to review and manage the jobs in an enviornment using the Python SDK.
